Trending Photos Reporter: Arvind Singh The Supreme Court has expressed displeasure over the Kolkata High Court's advice to girls suggesting them to control their desire for sex. The SC emphasized that courts should refrain from offering personal opinions or advice while delivering judgments and stated that the High Court's comments were highly objectionable and unnecessary, constituting a violation of fundamental rights under Article 21. The court appointed advocate Madhavi Diwan as Amicus Curiae and sought clarification from the state government if they intend to file an appeal against the High Court's decision. The government's counsel is directed to inform the court about their stance. Previously, the Kolkata High Court, in a ruling regarding a case of sexual harassment with a minor, had stated that girls should control their desire for sex and not focus on fleeting pleasures, which the Supreme Court found objectionable. Additionally, the court had advised boys to respect the dignity of girls. The accused boy, after making statements acknowledging consensual sexual relations with the girl, was acquitted of charges related to the POCSO Act. The High Court had underscored the importance of parental guidance for teenagers and advocated for comprehensive sex education. It stressed the inclusion of topics such as reproductive health, hygiene, and related aspects as essential components in the curriculum of every school.

TMC MP Mahua Moitra Expelled From Lok Sabha In Cash For Query Case,https://zeenews.india.com/india/breaking-tmc-mp-mahua-moitra-expelled-from-lok-sabha-in-cash-for-query-case-2696636.html,"Friday, December 08, 2023, 15:45 GMT +5:30",Zee News,"TMC MP Mahua Moitra Expelled From Lok Sabha In Cash For Query Case The Ethics Committee report probing 'Unethical Conduct' of Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra in the ""cash for query"" case was tabled in the Lok Sabha on Friday. The Ethics Committee report probing 'Unethical Conduct' of Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra in the ""cash for query"" case was tabled in the Lok Sabha on Friday. Trending Photos TMC Member of Parliament Mahua Moitra has been expelled from the Lok Sabha on the recommendations of the Ethics Committee that investigated allegations against her in the cash for query case. The decision was taken by the lower house after discussion. While opposition members voiced support for Moitra, the NDA allies raised the issue citing national security. While NDA allies voted in favour of her expulsion, the opposition members had staged a walk out of the lower house as Moitra was not allowed to sepak. ""This House accepts the conclusions of the Committee that MP Mahua Moitra's conduct was immoral and indecent as an MP. So, it is not appropriate for her to continue as an MP,"" said Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla annoucing the decision. Speaking to media, Mahua Moitra alleged that the move is aimed at bulldozing the opposition. She claimed that there is no evidence of receiving any kickbacks from the said businessman. She said that the government wanted to shut her up for speaking against Adani. ""If this Modi government thought that by shutting me up they could do away with the Adani issue, let me tell you this that this kangaroo court has only shown to all of India that the haste and the abuse of due process demonstrates how important Adani is to you. And to what length you will go to harass a single woman MP into shutting her into submission,"" said Moitra. Mahua Moitra also claimed that the BJP cannot tolerate 'nari shakti' and rise of minorities. She said that the Ethics Committee has no power to expel and the BJP misused parliamentary committees. ""I am 49 years old, I will fight you for the next 30 years inside Parliament, outside Parliament,"" said Moitra. Speaking during the debate, TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee said, ""The fair trial would be there only when an affected is being heard. If an affected person is not heard, there cannot be any fair trial...Today, we are deciding the right of a person. When we are deciding the right of a person, we are all acting as a quasi-judicial body."" Congress MP Manish Tewari said that the recommendation of the Ethics Committee was flawed. ""I have carefully read Rule 316(d) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business. It says that the recommendations of the Committee shall be presented in the form of a report...Ethics Committee can recommend if a person is guilty or innocent but it can't recommend their punishment. That power lies with this House. The Ethics Committee, at best, can make a recommendation that whether a person is guilty or innocent. It is this House sitting as jury which has the powers to decide the quantum of punishment. So, the recommendation of the Ethics Committee is fundamentally flawed in my respectful submission,"" said Tewari. The Ethics Committee report probing 'Unethical Conduct' of Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra in the ""cash for query"" case that was tabled in the Lok Sabha on Friday had recommended that Moitra ""may be expelled"" from the Lok Sabha. The committee also called for an legal, institutional inquiry by the central government in the matter. ""The serious misdemeanours on the part of Mahua Moitra calls for severe punishment. The Committee, therefore, recommend that Mahua Moitra, MP may be expelled from the Membership of the Seventeenth Lok Sabha,"" the report read. The Committee also recommended an investigation by the government into the 'money trail' of cash transactions between Mahua Moitra and Darshan Hiranandani as a part of 'quid pro quo'. The Ethics Committee, which investigated the allegations made by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, adopted its 500-page report on November 9 recommending Moitra's expulsion from the 17th Lok Sabha in view of her ""highly objectionable, unethical, heinous and criminal conduct.""

A few months ago, a shocking murder case came to light where a live-in partner murdered his girlfriend. The case made national headlines due to its brutality. Trending Photos The concept of live-in has gradually picked up among adults, especially in urban areas where youth come for jobs and studies. When an adult male and a female start living together under one roof without marriage, it is called a live-in relationship. Their relationship is similar to that of a husband and wife, but they do not have the bond of marriage. The concept of live-in may appear beneficial to some and against the culture to some, but the fact is that it has been gaining popularity among the new generation. A few months ago, a shocking murder case came to light where a live-in partner murdered his girlfriend. The case made national headlines due to its brutality. The victim was Shraddha Walkar and the accused was Aftab. Aftab had reportedly chopped Shraddha's body into about 35 pieces and dumped her at different locations. At that time, there was also a debate about whether a live-in relationship should be acceptable or not. Now, the issue has reached Parliament as well. BJP MP Dharambir Singh has termed it a 'disease' and demanded legislation against it. He also presented his argument while mentioning the Shraddha Walke murder case. If you ask the general public or on social media whether there should be a law regarding live-in relationships, some people will surely say that when a boy and a girl are adults, why should the government interfere in their personal matters? Haryana MP Dharambir Singh raised the issue of live-in relationships in the Lok Sabha, stating that it is a serious and concerning issue. Everyone knows that Indian culture is renowned for brotherhood and 'vasudhaiva kutumbakam' (the world is one family). Our social fabric is unique in the world. People worldwide admire the 'unity in diversity' of Indian culture. The tradition of arranged marriages has been prevalent in Indian society for centuries. Even today, a significant section of the country prioritizes marriages arranged by parents or family members. The consent of the bride and groom is also considered. The BJP MP from Bhiwani-Mahendragarh mentioned that traditional marriages consider many aspects such as social and personal values and preferences. The background of families is also given priority. Marriage is considered a sacred bond in India that lasts for seven generations and thus divorce rate here is very low, he said. The MP highlighted that the divorce rate has been increasing in India mostly due to love marriages. He suggested that parents' consent be made mandatory in love marriages as well. He further stated that a new ailment has emerged in society these days, mostly prevalent in Western countries, termed 'live-in relationship.' He said that its consequences are dreadful and highlighted the incidence of the Shraddha Walkar murder case. He said that incidents like these are ruining Indian culture and spreading hatred and evil in society. If this continues, our culture will eventually collapse. He demanded the government to urgently pass laws against live-in relationships. This is a significant issue. The concerns of the Member of Parliament are not baseless or trivial. His concerns are valid given the recent incidents. However, banning 'live-in' is not practically possible and also not good for a democratic country as it comes under fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution. Parents should strive to ingrain the right values in their kids. They should focus on better parenting and restoring moral and cultural values in the kids to avoid facing such situations. In India where the concept of joint and extended families is still relevant today, moral policing in such critical issues may have a negative effect on the minds of youth. Today, even though people live in flats and high-rise societies in a nuclear family, they still rush back to their native places during festivals. Indians always stay connected with their roots. Now, is sharing a flat or room with a boy or girl is necessary? This question needs to be left to the youth. There should be a positive debate on this matter. Indian youth need to understand the ideas and cultural values that our society has. They should be allowed to present their sides as well so that their parents can also understand their thought process.

In the alleged ""cash-for-query"" case, the Ethics Committee adopted its 500-page report on November 9 recommending Moitra's expulsion from the 17th Lok Sabha given her ""highly objectionable, unethical, heinous and criminal conduct. Trending Photos A heated discussion is expected in the Parliament today. The report of the Ethics Committee on Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra in an alleged ""cash-for-query"" case is being tabled in Lok Sabha today as the Parliament convenes on Day 5 of the ongoing Winter Session. The report was mentioned in the agenda of the list of business of Lok Sabha for the opening day (December 4) of the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament but it could not be taken up. The Ethics Committee, which investigated the allegations made by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, adopted its 500-page report on November 9 recommending Moitra's expulsion from the 17th Lok Sabha given her ""highly objectionable, unethical, heinous and criminal conduct. The draft report was adopted by a 6:4 majority in the panel last month. It has been alleged Moitra gave her parliament login ID to businessman Darshan Hiranandani to target the Adani Group and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In an affidavit, Hiranandani alleged the Trinamool MP shared her official MP email so that he could send her information and she could raise questions in parliament. He alleged that later, the MP later gave him her parliament login and password for him to post the questions directly. While Moitra has refuted the cash-for-query allegations, she admitted to giving her parliamentary login ID to businessman Darshan Hiranandani. As per the sources, the draft report on Mahua Moitra's cash-for-questions case reveals that she visited the UAE four times from 2019 to 2023 while her login was accessed several times. ""On 47 occasions, her member portal login credentials were accessed from Dubai,"" sources said citing the draft report of the ethics committee. Nishikant Dubey had written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla against Moitra, accusing her of asking questions in Lok Sabha to target the Adani Group at the behest of businessman Darshan Hiranandani in exchange for gifts. However, several leaders of the opposition, including Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP Danish Ali and Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury have opposed the report. The TMC has demanded that the MP Mahua Moitra be given a chance to put forth her defence. TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said, ""I spoke with the Speaker, and he said that this committee report along with other reports will be tabled. I said that TMC MP Mahua Moitra should be given a chance to speak."" Meanwhile, Congress Lok Sabha Chief Whip K Suresh said, ""Today, the Ethics Committee report is being tabled. It is already included in the List of Business in Lok Sabha. Let us see what report are they going to table in the House.

No Consensus Yet, BJP Picks 9 Observers For 3 States CM Race: While suspense about who the three chief ministers will grow, BJP national president JP Nadda had a key meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in the national capital on Thursday. CM Race: While suspense about who the three chief ministers will grow, BJP national president JP Nadda had a key meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in the national capital on Thursday. Trending Photos The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) registered resounding wins in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh in the recent Assembly elections, leaving Congress languishing at a distant second spot. But the BJP is yet to announce the names of chief ministers in the three states even as speculations and suspense grow. In all three states, the BJP fought the elections without naming any chief ministerial candidate. The BJP has now picked three observers each for the three states (a total of nine observers). The observers will be tasked with the duty of overseeing meetings of the newly elected MLAs in the three states, where they will pick their leaders. Here are the names, as per reports: Rajasthan - Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, party National General Secretary Vinod Tawade and Rajya Sabha MP Saroj Pandey Madhya Pradesh - Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, OBC morcha chief K Laxman and National Secretary Asha Lakhra Chhattisgarh - Agriculture and Tribal Affairs Minister Arjun Munda, Ports and Shipping Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, and National General Secretary Dushyant Kumar Gautam On Thursday, BJP national president JP Nadda was seen leaving the residence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah in the national capital after a key meeting. Earlier in Bhopal, while saying that the final decision on the CMs for Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan would be taken on December 10, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya refrained from disclosing whether the party will select leaders from among the newly elected MLAs or bring in outsiders. Even as feverish speculations over the BJP's CM picks in these three states continued, former Rajasthan chief minister and BJP leader Vasundhara Raje, on Thursday, called on Nadda at the latter's residence in the national capital. Vasundhara Raje, a two-time chief minister; Diya Kumari, who has been elected MLA from Vidyadhar Nagar; Mahat Balak Nath, who won from the Tijara constituency; and Rajyavarardhan Singh Rathore, who won from the Jhotwara constituency, are believed to be among the top contenders for the post in Rajasthan. The BJP swept the Hindi heartland on the counting day for four states that polled for their assemblies last month. With its stunning mandates in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, the BJP stumped not just their rivals but also some pollsters who had predicted tight races in these states. The BJP, which had been battling close to 20 years of incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, won a resounding mandate bagging 163 seats while the Congress finished a distant second at 66 seats. In Rajasthan, the vote count painted a starkly different picture to what some of the pollsters had predicted, with the BJP poised to form the government, winning 115 seats, and the Congress trailing at 69 seats. Of the 90 assembly constituencies in Chhattisgarh, the BJP bagged 54 while the Congress won 35.

As several areas remain waterlogged and relief works are underway in rain-affected areas, educational institutes in Chennai remain closed today. Trending Photos Schools and colleges in Chennai are closed today (Friday, December 8) due to relief work in areas adversely affected by the rain. At least 20 people have been killed in rain-related incidents in the city. As an impact of cyclone Michaung, the Tamil Nadu capital has witnessed water logging in several parts of Chennai city. Cyclone Michaung brought with it heavy rains, strong winds, and subsequent damages to infrastructure and homes, apart from the loss of lives. It finally made landfall in Andhra Pradesh and subsequently weakened into a deep depression. Briefing about the restoration work that is underway in Chennai after cyclone Michaung hit the city, Tamil Nadu chief secretary Shiv Das Meena on Thursday said that 9,000 officials from other districts are deployed for the relief work. ""Work on water stagnation at 343 places is underway. Food packets are being distributed in the flood-affected areas. Other district workers like medical staff, fire service staff, EN staff, etc., have been called to work in Chennai for restoration. A total of 9,000 officials from other districts are also deployed for the relief work in Chennai,"" Meena said. Meanwhile, the Central government has released in advance its share of the second instalment of the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) of Rs 493.60 crore to Andhra Pradesh and Rs 450 crore to Tamil Nadu, the two states that bore the impact of the cyclonic storm Michaung.

Though the extent of damage is varied, many areas of these states are inundated, thus affecting standing crops."" The authorities have yet to quantify the exact loss caused by the submergence. ""To help the state governments with the management of relief necessitated by the cyclonic storm, PM @narendramodi Ji directed the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to release in advance the central share of the 2nd instalment of SDRF of Rs 493.60 to Andhra Pradesh and Rs 450 crore to Tamil Nadu,"" Shah posted. The Minister also mentioned that the centre had already released the first instalment of the same amount to both states. He further prayed for the safety and well-being of all those affected. The cyclone made landfall on the Andhra Pradesh coast near Bapatla on Tuesday afternoon, accompanied by intense rain and wind speeds up to 100 kmph, causing widespread devastation and affecting more than two crore people. The storm has claimed over a dozen lives so far. Thousands of ground-floor homes and vehicles remained submerged. In Andhra, the cyclone wreaked havoc on thousands of acres of standing crops, primarily paddy. Around 10,000 people were evacuated. The Tamil Nadu capital remained waterlogged due to the incessant downpour, with over 61,000 people seeking refuge in government-run shelters. Many others checked into service apartments and budget hotels due to shortages of water, essentials, and electricity. Civil and military rescuers evacuated Chennai residents, including women, senior citizens, and pets. Army helicopters dropped food packets to affected areas.

""Today, he (Nawab Malik) came to Vidhan Sabha and was sitting on the ruling party's side. So, the BJP wrote this letter as a way of offering an explanation to the people (for the split in the NCP). Instead of sending a letter to Ajit Pawar, he (Fadnavis) could have just called and informed him. I think this letter was the government's way of giving an explanation (amid Malik's induction to the ruling alliance) to the people of Maharashtra,"" Patil told reporters in Mumbai on Thursday. Congress leader and the Leader of the Opposition in the Maharashtra Assembly, Vijay Wadettiwar, said, ""I feel that Nawab Malik is with the 'Mahayuti' (grand alliance)."" Fadnavis on Thursday wrote to his cabinet colleague and NCP leader Ajit Pawar, expressing opposition to the induction of Malik in the ruling 'Maha Yuti' or grand alliance in the state. ""Given that he is an accused (in a money laundering case), we are of the opinion that it would not be proper to induct him into the ruling alliance. Power comes and goes but the country is paramount,"" Fadnavis said. ""We agree that it is your prerogative (to decide) who should be inducted in your party. But every constituent (in the Maha Yuti) has to think as to whether it would harm the alliance,"" Fadnavis said, adding, ""Hence, we are opposed to this"". Malik is currently out on medical bail after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested him in February 2022 in a money-laundering probe linked to the activities of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim and his aides. Malik was a cabinet minister in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government at the time of his arrest. Malik attended the Winter Session of the Maharashtra Assembly here for the first time since his bail on Thursday. He sat on the last bench in the assembly, next to the MLAs of the Ajit Pawar-led faction of the Nationalist Congress Party.

By: एबीपी लाइव | Updated at : 09 Dec 2023 12:11 AM (IST) बीजेपी सीएम रेस ( Image Source : ABP Live ) मध्य प्रदेश, छत्तीसगढ़ और राजस्थान में नया मुख्यमंत्री कौन बनेगा, इस सवाल पर हलचल के बीच बीजेपी नेताओं मुलाकातों का दौर जारी है. हालांकि, बीजेपी ने शुक्रवार (8 दिसंबर) तीनों राज्यों में अपने विधायक दल के नेता चुनने के लिए केंद्रीय पर्यवेक्षकों की नियुक्ति कर दी. तीनों राज्यों में विधायक दल का नेता चुने जाने के बाद उन्हें मुख्यमंत्री बनाया जाएगा. विधायक दल की बैठक रविवार को छत्तीसगढ़ में होगी, वहीं, सोमवार को राजस्थान और मध्य प्रदेश में बैठक होगी. रक्षा मंत्री राजनाथ सिंह को राजस्थान का पर्यवेक्षक नियुक्त किया गया है. मध्य प्रदेश के लिए हरियाणा के मुख्यमंत्री मनोहर लाल खट्टर को पर्यवेक्षक बनाया गया है और जनजातीय मामलों के मंत्री अर्जुन मुंडा को छत्तीसगढ़ के लिए पर्यवेक्षक की जिम्मेदारी दी गई है. राजनाथ सिंह के साथ पार्टी की उपाध्यक्ष सरोज पांडे और महासचिव विनोद तावड़े राजस्थान के लिए केंद्रीय पर्यवेक्षक की भूमिका निभाएंगे. मध्य प्रदेश विधायक दल की बैठक में मनोहर लाल खट्टर के साथ पार्टी के ओबीसी मोर्चा के प्रमुख के लक्ष्मण और सचिव आशा लाकड़ा भी शामिल होंगी, जबकि केंद्रीय मंत्री सर्बानंद सोनोवाल और बीजेपी महासचिव दुष्यंत कुमार गौतम अर्जुन मुंडा के साथ छत्तीसगढ़ के लिए केंद्रीय पर्यवेक्षक होंगे. किसने किससे की मुलाकात? तीनों राज्यों में बीजेपी के सीएम पद की दौड़ पर अटकलों के बीच शुक्रवार (8 दिसंबर) को तिजारा से नवनिर्वाचित बीजेपी विधायक बाबा बालकनाथ और राजस्थान के ऑब्जर्वर सरोज पांडेय ने पार्टी अध्यक्ष जेपी नड्डा से मुलाकात की. बीजेपी के राष्ट्रीय महासचिव तरुण भी जेपी नड्डा से मिले. ज्योतिरादित्य सिंधिया ने भी शुक्रवार को संसद भवन में बीजेपी अध्यक्ष जेपी नड्डा से मुलाकात की. उधर राजस्थान के लिए निकलने से पहले राजनाथ सिंह ने जेपी नड्डा के आवास पर उनसे मुलाकात की. सीपी जोशी और प्रह्लाद जोशी भी नड्डा से मिलने पहुंचे थे. वहीं, गुरुवार को बीजेपी अध्यक्ष जेपी नड्डा से मिलने के बाद राजस्थान की पूर्व सीएम वसुंधरा राजे अमित शाह के आवास पर उनसे मुलाकात करने पहुंची थीं. शिवराज से मिले प्रहलाद पटेल मध्य प्रदेश की नरसिंहपुर सीट चुनाव जीते केंद्रीय मंत्री प्रहलाद सिंह पटेल ने शुक्रवार को मध्य प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री शिवराज सिंह चौहान से मुलाकात की. पटेल ने सीएम से मिलने का समय मांगा था. शिवराज चौहान दिन में गुना में थे. जैसे ही वह भोपाल लौटे तो दोनों नेताओं ने शिष्टाचार मुलाकात की. पटेल ने सीएम शिवराज को गुलदस्ता भेंट किया. इसी के साथ अटकलों जोर पकड़ने लगीं कि पटेल सीएम की रेस में सबसे आगे हैं. दिल्ली नहीं आए शिवराज, मिशन 2024 के लिए हुए बिजी बता दें कि अन्य नेताओं की तरह शिवराज सिंह चौहान केंद्रीय नेतृत्व से मुलाकात करने के लिए दिल्ली नहीं आए हैं. सूत्रों के मुताबिक, विधानसभा चुनाव के नतीजे आने के बाद शिवराज लोकसभा चुनाव 2024 मिशन में व्यस्त हो गए हैं. चुनाव नतीजे आने के बाद वह दो दिन भोपाल में थे. इसके बाद वह मिशन 24 पर निकल पड़े. 6 दिसंबर को वह छिंदवाड़ा पहुंचे थे. 7 दिसंबर को सीएम श्योपुर में थे और 8 दिसंबर को गुना पहुंचे. शिवराज चौहान ने मीडिया से कहा, ''मै यहां मोदी जी के लिए मध्य प्रदेश में लोकसभा की सभी 29 सीटें जिताने के लिए आया हूं. हम मोदी जी के गले में 29 सीटों की हारों की माला पहनाएंगे.'' मध्य प्रदेश, छत्तीसगढ़ और राजस्थान बीजेपी में हलचल बीजेपी के भीतर इस बात की चर्चा है कि केंद्रीय नेतृत्व इन राज्यों में नए चेहरों को आगे ला सकता है. नेतृत्व राजस्थान में दो बार की पूर्व सीएम वसुंधरा राजे के दावे को नजरअंदाज कर सकता है. राजस्थान में वसुंधरा राजे और बाबा बालकनाथ के अलावा, गजेंद्र सिंह शेखावत, अश्विनी वैष्णव, दीया कुमारी, अर्जुन राम मेघवाल और ओम माथुर भी सीएम पद के दावेदार माने जा रहे हैं. बीजेपी के सबसे वरिष्ठ नेताओं में से एक राजनाथ सिंह की पसंद से विधायकों के बीच मुख्यमंत्री पद की पसंद को लेकर आम सहमति बनने में मदद मिलने की संभावना है. हालांकि, कई विधायकों को राजे का समर्थन करते देखा गया है. मध्य प्रदेश में जहां बीजेपी ने दो-तिहाई बहुमत के साथ तीन राज्यों में अपनी सबसे बड़ी जीत हासिल की है, वहां इस जीत के साथ ही मौजूदा मुख्यमंत्री शिवराज सिंह चौहान का दांव भी बढ़ गया है लेकिन एक राय यह भी है कि पार्टी नेतृत्व (2018 के विधानसभा चुनावों के बाद 15 महीनों को छोड़कर) सत्ता में उनके 18 साल के निर्बाध कार्यकाल के बाद नेतृत्व परिवर्तन पर विचार कर रहा है. प्रहलाद पटेल, नरेंद्र सिंह तोमर और वीडी शर्मा को सीएम पद की रेस में माना जा रहा है. सूत्रों के मुताबिक, बीजेपी छत्तीसगढ़ में किसी ओबीसी या आदिवासी नेता को कमान सौंपने पर विचार कर रही है. पिछड़ी जाति आने वाले प्रदेश अध्यक्ष अरुण साव और नौकरशाह से नेता बने ओपी चौधरी के अलावा लता उसेंडी, गोमती साय और रेणुका सिंह जैसे एसटी नेता शीर्ष पद के लिए स्वाभाविक दावेदार हैं. चूंकि प्रधानमंत्री नरेंद्र मोदी महिला मतदाताओं के बीजेपी के प्रति समर्थन को जाहिर करते रहे हैं और अक्सर महिलाओं के नेतृत्व वाले विकास की जरूरत के बारे में बात करते रहे हैं, इसलिए पार्टी महिला मुख्यमंत्री को भी चुन सकती है. बता दें कि छत्तीसगढ़ के तीन पर्यवेक्षकों में से दो आदिवासी समुदाय से हैं जबकि गौतम अनुसूचित जाति से आते हैं. बता दें कि बीजेपी ने हाल ही में हुए विधानसभा चुनावों में तीन राज्यों में भारी अंतर से जीत हासिल की है और उनमें से प्रत्येक में कांग्रेस की चुनौती को दरकिनार किया है. यह भी पढ़ें- इस्तीफा देने वाले बीजेपी सांसदों को बंगला खाली करने का नोटिस Cash-For-Query Case: द्रौपदी चीरहरण-देवियों से महुआ की तुलना करने पर भड़कीं बीजेपी MP हिना, क्या कुछ कहा?

Karti Chidambaram's Cricket Analogy On Mahua Moitra's Expulsion,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/karti-chidambarams-cricket-analogy-on-mahua-moitras-expulsion-4648149,"Sat, 09 Dec 2023 00:50:21 +0530",N/A,"Karti Chidambaram's Cricket Analogy On Mahua Moitra's Expulsion Mahua Moitra was expelled from the Lok Sabha after the House adopted the report of its ethics committee that held her guilty of accepting gifts and illegal gratification from a businessman to further his interest. He said Ms Moitra is going to come back to the 18th Lok Sabha with a bigger winning margin of votes. Congress MP Karti Chidambaram on Friday used the analogy of Sri Lankan cricketer Angelo Mathews' timed-out dismissal in the recently-held cricket World Cup while slamming the government over the expulsion of TMC MP Mahua Moitra from the Lok Sabha in a ""cash-for-query"" case. Ms Moitra was expelled from the Lok Sabha after the House adopted the report of its ethics committee that held her guilty of accepting gifts and illegal gratification from a businessman to further his interest. After a heated debate over the panel report during which Ms Moitra was not allowed to speak, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi moved a motion to expel the Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP for ""unethical conduct"", which was adopted by a voice vote. Talking to PTI outside Parliament, Mr Chidambaram said a woman, particularly a single woman who has been humiliated and wronged, only rises in politics. He said Ms Moitra is going to come back to the 18th Lok Sabha with a bigger winning margin of votes. ""It is a very unfortunate event. The House has relied on a very erroneous report, a report which has no legal basis. The report has violated every principle of natural justice and the procedure of evidence,"" he said. ""There has been a complaint, there has been an ethics committee, there has been a recommendation and there has been an acceptance of it, which is only an eyewash,"" the Congress MP said. He alleged that this was akin to weaponising the law to eliminate an opponent. ""Two weeks ago, there was the World Cup and Angelo Mathews was timed out by Shakib (Al Hasan) of Bangladesh. Even though it was within the law, people said it was against the spirit of cricket. In India, people do not mind if one is defeated, they do not like it when you humiliate someone,"" Ms Chidambaram said. Mathews became the first batsman to be dismissed ""timed out"" in international cricket when he failed to take the strike within the stipulated time of two minutes following the dismissal of Sadeera Samarawickrama in their World Cup match against Bangladesh, triggering a controversy. The Sri Lankan player had called Bangladesh's decision to dismiss him via time out ""disgraceful"". The players of the two teams did not shake hands with each other after the match on November 7. Mr Chidambaram also drew a parallel with the Mahabharat, sayings the same thing happened in Kurukshetra when Karna was killed by Arjuna by unethical means. ""His kavach was taken, his kundal was taken, his astra was taken, then you did a fake eclipse and his chariot was stuck in the mud, then Arjuna killed him at the behest of Krishna and both their karma became bad because of that,"" the Congress leader said. ""In my limited experience in politics, I can tell you that a woman, particularly a single woman who has been humiliated and wronged, only rises in politics and I can assure you that Mahua Moitra is going to come back to the 18th Lok Sabha with a bigger majority,"" he added. Mr Chidambaram also pointed out that paragraph 72 on page 52 of the report says the panel found that Ms Moitra's conduct was ""highly objectionable, unethical, heinous and criminal"" but in the very next line, it recommends an ""intense legal, institutional inquiry by the government in a time-bound manner"". ""After finding her conduct criminal, you are asking for an inquiry. So how can you find someone's conduct criminal and then ask for an inquiry? You should have done an inquiry before coming to the conclusion that you are a criminal. If you find somebody a criminal, you must follow the procedure that means you should allow cross-examination,"" he said. Two people levelled allegations against Ms Moitra and were not cross-examined, Mr Chidambaram said. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com ""This is a completely flawed report.

The Special Cell of the Delhi Police has arrested two Haryana-based sharpshooters of Lawrence Bishnoi and Goldy Brar gang for allegedly being involved in a firing incident outside the residence of a former Punjab MLA, officials said on Friday. Police have arrested Sonipat resident Aakash (23) and Charkhi Dadri resident Nitesh (19) for firing more than eight rounds of bullets outside the Delhi house of Deep Malhotra, a former Shiromani Akali Dal MLA from Punjab's Faridkot. Two pistols, six live cartridges and a stolen motorcycle used in the crime were recovered from their possession.

""On December 3, two armed assailants fired at the main gate of the house of a former MLA at west Punjabi Bagh area,"" Special Commissioner of Police (crime) Ravindra Singh Yadav said. Yadav said several teams of Delhi police rushed to the spot and recovered four empty cartridges near the main gate of the house.

One of the grounds on which Nayak was granted bail was the delay in the trial. Mohan Nayak N, the 11th accused in the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh, has been granted bail by the High Court of Karnataka. The allegation against Nayak was that ""he had conspired with the other accused persons to commit the murder of deceased Gauri Lankesh and in furtherance of such conspiracy, he had taken a house for rent at Ramanagara in an isolated place and had given shelter in the said house to accused number 2 & 3 who are the actual assailants in the present case."" He is the first accused in the case to obtain bail, which was granted by the single judge bench of Justice S Vishwajith Shetty.

This Court on 11.02.2019 directed the Trial Court to expedite the trial. Though charges were framed in the present case on 30.10.2021, for the last more than two years, only 90 witnesses have been examined. There are more than 400 charge sheet witnesses who are yet to be examined in the case.

Nayak is in custody since July 18, 2018. Considering the delay, the HC said, ""Petitioner has been in custody for the last more than five years. Though Section 22(4) of COCA provides for certain rigors for enlarging the accused on bail as against whom charges are made for the offences punishable under the COCA, the same cannot fetter the powers of this Court to enlarge the accused on bail when there is undue delay in trial and the material on record would go to show that the trial may not be completed any time soon."" ""From a perusal of the order sheet maintained by the Trial Court in Spl.CC.No.872/2018, it is seen that delay in trial cannot be attributed to the accused,"" it said granting him bail.

PM Modi received 76 percent approval rating (File) BJP leaders asserted on Friday that ""Modi ki guarantee"" and ""Modi's magic"" have been endorsed even by an international survey as Prime Minister Narendra Modi topped the approval ratings among several world leaders. The weekly survey by Morning Consult had PM Modi topping the popularity chart yet again as he received 76 percent approval rating with only 18 percent disapproving his leadership. Mexican leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was second in the popularity chart with 66 percent in approval against 29 percent giving a thumbs down to his leadership. The corresponding figures for Swiss leader Alain Berset were 58 percent and 28 percent. BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said that after the assembly election results, even an international poll has given a thumbs up to Modi's guarantee and magic, which is about his model of governance and delivery. He noted that Modi scored high ratings even during an international crisis like Covid-19 when other world leaders suffered in popular support. It is because he had been able to deliver on development and growth while managing inflation and taking more than 13.5 crore people out of poverty. The approval rating will be reflected in the Lok Sabha polls in 2024, Mr Poonawalla said. BJP leader C T Ravi lauded Modi as a ""karma yogi"" who has been notching up high approval ratings due to his hardwork, vision and dedication to transforming the country.

The CJI also spoke about how India's post-independence journey was unique. (FILE) The polarisation across the world, with India not being an exception, is marked by the growth of social media and growing intolerance among communities, Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud said here on Friday. Speaking at the Jamnalal Bajaj Awards function, he also said India's pluralistic culture and ""ability to engage in dialogue"" set it apart from many other countries which got independence during the same period but could not sustain democracy. “Much of the polarization which we see across the globalized world....the polarization between right and left and the center....the polarization which we experience across the world and India is no exception, is also marked by the growth of social media, the sense of intolerance among communities, the short attention span which the younger generation has,” DY Chandrachud said. This was not an isolated phenomenon, and free markets and technology produced it, he added. The CJI also spoke about how India's post-independence journey was unique. Along with India, several other countries got freedom from colonial rule 75 years ago, but many of them were unable to attain true self- governance, while India was able to sustain its democracy, the CJI pointed out. “What is that sets India apart from so many nations across the world which became free with us around the same time, but were not able to sustain freedom as a way of life? Some may possibly say that we internalized democracy, we have internalized constitutional values. Others will say the strength of our nation lies in its pluralistic culture, the culture of inclusion, the culture of all encompassing humanity,” he stated. The ""power of gun"" got the better of the rule of law in many countries, but India survived through the tough time because of our ability to engage in dialogue, DY Chandrachud added. Public service is of paramount importance for a thriving society, but very few individuals embrace it wholeheartedly due to the challenges and barriers they encounter along the way, he said. “Choosing a public service path often requires personal and professional sacrifice. Individuals may find themselves navigating a delicate balance where the demand of public duty clashes with the need of personal and career pursuits,"" the CJI said. The judges see injustice ""face to face"", and while they try to resolve injustice within the boundaries of law, they also realize the limitations of law in creating a truly just society, he said. “The importance of law lies in its ability to create a framework where there is an organized discourse possible, as I said where we replace the power bullets with power of reason. But equally, there is justice beyond the law and for justice beyond law we need to fathom our own hearts and our own communities to tap the innate goodness in the individual,” Chandrachud said. “Because the law can be a source of immense good, but law can be a source of immense arbitrariness (too). It depends on who wields the law and what are the social conditions in which the law is wielded,” he added.

Apple farming had brought prosperity to many of his neighbours in the village of 150 households, after many of them converted their maize fields into apple orchards from 2000 onwards. Rajab would arrive early in the morning to tend to his apple trees. He would regularly spray them with pesticides and nutrients and employ scientific techniques such as maintaining 10-20 feet distance between them. When the fruit was ripening, he would stay the night at the orchard to protect it from wild bears. “I nurtured the orchard like a child,” says Rajab, in the hope that it would fetch him quality yield and profit.

After repeated requests, the school was allotted two visiting teaching assistants, appointed on contract by the state government. The three teachers are helping students prepare for the Gujarat Board Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examinations due to be held early next year.

The state government has decided to allot apartments in slum redevelop­ment schemes at Rs 2.5 lakh to residents of shanties that have come up between 2000 and 2011.

A chic new riverfront is the latest addition to that frenzied beautification, though it has landed in a controversy over allegedly flouting environmental norms. Amid criticism, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot decided to distance himself from the inauguration. But can he justify the wanton spending on other projects? A helical clover bridge sounds like a sleek thing right out of some First World xanadu. This one, built at a cost of Rs 42 crore, is in Rajasthan’s Kota, but it soars and twists balletically too, for about a kilometre, except that it lands a few metres from where it started. Even more mystifyingly, it soars over nothing: there’s no crossing or rail track or any form of obstruction underneath. Just a few minutes away, along the Chambal, a new riverfront was inaugurated with great pomp on September 12—a costly façade laid end-to-end over three kilometres of natural rock and soil like a pink stone shroud, leaving not even parts of the riverbed, let alone a scrap of greenery. In its place have come up 26 spanking new ghats strung along imitation Rajputana architectural chic. Turrets and chhatris in the local Hadauti style. An army of giant statues, one of which, a 25-feet Yogimudra, vanishes when you see it straight on. Another curiosity is both visible and audible: the world’s largest bell whose boom, they say, can be heard eight kilometres away and, coming in at 82 tonnes on the scale, is no bantamweight either. Goddess Chambal, a deity who’s considered cursed and hence is rarely worshipped, also gets a 242-feet-high statue of Vietnamese marble here. The riverfront is studded liberally with replicas that stand like displaced metaphors, such as a highrise Red Fort or the Chinese Pagoda. Add a proposed boat cruise, a water park, a train on tyres, golf carts, skating area, the world’s second-largest musical fountain, cafes, restaurants, a commercial complexâ€æ in short, it’s the full fairground cornucopia. Kota (North) MLA and Rajasthan urban development minister Shanti Dhariwal, whose brainchild this frenzied beautification is, wanted to outdo the Kashi Corridor and the Sabarmati riverfront and take Kota right into the elite club of Paris and London. Dumb-struck critics call it the “world’s only copycat heritage waterfront”."

Since 2016, around 58 ‘Maratha Kranti Morchas’—some of them having hundreds of thousands of people joining them—were organised in Maharashtra and neighbouring states. The agitation turned violent in 2018, further beleaguering the then Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Shiv Sena coalition. There was speculation that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which has a strong base among the Marathas and was then in the Opposition, had fuelled these protests to corner Fadnavis, a Brahmin. However, the Maratha protests saw counter-mobilisation by the non-Marathas, especially by the upwardly mobile other backward classes (OBCs), who felt that the Marathas would eventually eat into their 27 per cent share of reservations. These groups organised ‘Bahujan Kranti Morchas’ across the state on similar lines."

Xi’s skipping of G20 Summit may have more to do with China than with India,https://www.indiatoday.in/nation/story/xi-jinping-g20-summit-delhi-not-attending-due-to-political-china-economy-political-troubles-military-purge-2432412-2023-09-07?utm_source=rss,"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 16:30:23+05:30",N/A,"Xi’s skipping of G20 Summit may have more to do with China than with India Chinese President Xi Jinping is giving a miss to G20 Summit in New Delhi. But if experts are to be believed, it might have more to do with Xi's economic and political problems at home than China's friction with India. Listen to Story Chinese President Xi Jinping was born in the lap of luxury but, as his father was purged during China’s Cultural Revolution, a young Xi had to toil in the farms as a manual labourer in the countryside for 6 years. Those struggles would be nothing compared to the task the all-supreme leader now faces. Xi is skipping the G20 Summit in New Delhi and experts have failed to pin-point the one big reason why China is sending Premier Li Qiang instead. It is true that China’s relationship with India has been mostly frosty since the border clashes in May 2020. And it is also possible that the Chinese government decided to send Premier Li Qiang instead of President Xi to send out a signal. But the Chinese government has maintained that it was ready to work with all the parties for the global event's success in New Delhi this week. Also, Xi might not want to share the stage with the “tough crowd” at the G20. Many G20 member countries have “hardened their positions on China” in the last decade, said Paul Haenle, director of think-tank Carnegie China, adding, “It’s a tough crowd for Xi”. What experts are also hinting at is that Xi Jinping’s skipping the India-hosted G20 event could be due to the mounting troubles in China itself. So, is Xi staying back home where the real trouble is? Given Xi's focus on domestic issues, he might be unwilling to travel abroad, Alfred Wu, said associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. “Xi Jinping is setting his own agenda where his top concern is national security and he has to stay in China and make foreign leaders visit him instead,” Wu told Reuters. Wu says the over-emphasis on security is hurting China’s diplomatic ties and the attempt to rejuvenate its economy. China’s economy is in bad shape, and it is among Xi’s biggest headaches.HOUSING CRISIS HITS CHINA’S ECONOMY It seems the Chinese economy hasn’t emerged entirely from the Covid blow. It is the first time in decades that China’s economy is facing pressures from multiple fronts, to an extent that the entire world is jittery. Compared to last year, Chinese households are spending less, factories are producing less, and businesses are investing more slowly. Exports have slumped too. In August, China's exports dropped 8.8 per cent year-on-year and its imports contracted 7.3 per cent. advertisementDue to the sharp increase in youth unemployment, Beijing decided to stop disclosing the data. In the meantime, property prices are falling and some major developers have declared bankruptcy, putting the real estate sector in danger.The current economic obstacles that China faces have the potential to create a lethal mix that might spell the conclusion of its 40-year-long successful growth model. Economists say that China’s overdependence on the property sector for years coupled with its stringent Covid-related policy has significantly hampered its economic growth.Economists have always flagged China's debt-fuelled growth. It is seeing an astronomical rise in debt. China’s total debt-to-GDP ratio stood at a record 279 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, according to a Bloomberg analysis.Beijing appears to have paid a significant price for too much infrastructure spending over the years in the form of huge debt, and the housing bubble has already burst during the epidemic, beginning with the Evergrande catastrophe.The bigger fear is the contagion to the financial market.

A special urgency to tend to the general weal seems to grip the Rajasthan chief minister especially before elections—a time such as now. Whether born of principle or exigency, this bent continues to give Rajasthan some pioneering policy moments. Back in 2011, during his second term, the Free Medicine Scheme was one such. More than an unthinking handout, it was an intervention that answered to a historical need, at a time when increasingly privatised healthcare was bleeding the mass of immiserated citizenry. Crafted around the procurement of generic medicines, it helped break the tyranny of huge mark-ups on branded drugs. Now, the budget session of 2023 brings forth two pieces of legislation that can have a similar historic stature in India, enacted as a response to the way the evolving economy is experienced at the bottom of the pyramid: the Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Bill, and the Minimum Income Guarantee Act."
