Amid the speculation of a surprise pick, the BJP has appointed Vishnu Deo Sai as the Chief Minister, said Zee News sources. Sai is the tribal face of the BJP. He is also a former MP and former Union Minister. He has got two Deputy Chief Ministers - Arun Sao and Vijay Sharma. On the other hand, former CM Raman Singh will be the speaker of the Chhattisgarh assembly, as per reports. Sai's elevation is BJP's attempt to set the caste equation right and woo the OBCs, tribals and Adivasi voters ahead of the Lok Sabha polls to be held in April-May next year.

Modi`s Masterstroke? Vishnu Deo Sai`s Elevation In Chhattisgarh And Poll Arithmetic,https://zeenews.india.com/india/modis-masterstroke-vishnu-deo-sais-elevation-in-chhattisgarh-and-poll-arithmetic-2697516.html,"Sunday, December 10, 2023, 19:30 GMT +5:30",Zee News,"Modi's Masterstroke? Vishnu Deo Sai's Elevation In Chhattisgarh And Poll Arithmetic Vishnu Deo Sai is a popular face in Chhattisgarh's tribal region and holds a good command within the organisation. Vishnu Deo Sai is a popular face in Chhattisgarh's tribal region and holds a good command within the organisation. Trending Photos The BJP today selected former Union Minister and tribal leader Vishnu Deo Sai as the next Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh. Sai was made the CM despite former CM Raman Singh being the strong contender. In fact, Raman Singh himself proposed the name of Sai for the top post. Selection Vishny Deo Sai can prove to be a masterstroke for the BJP not only in the state but also for the upcoming Lok Sabha assembly election. Vishnu Deo Sai is a popular face in Chhattisgarh's tribal region and holds a good command within the organisation. Chhattisgarh's total population consists of about 32% tribal, which is 7.5% of India's total tribal population. The state has 23 out of the 90 assembly seats reserved for the tribal community. Not only this, Sai hails from the influential Sahu (Teli) community which has a sizable presence in the Durg, Raipur and Bilaspur divisions. Vishnu Deo Sai comes from the Jashpur district which falls under the Sarguja Division (Northern Chhattisgarh). What is interesting is that the Sarguja division has six districts - Sarguja, Korea, Ramanujganj-Balrampur, Surajpur, Jashpur, and Manendragarh-Chirmiri-Bharatpur. These have a total of 14 assembly seats. In most of the elections, Sarguja electorates vote in a pattern. In 2003, the BJP had got 10 seats while the Congress had got just four. In 2008, the BJP got nine and five went to the Congress while in 2013, both the BJP and the Congress got seven each. In the 2018 assembly elections, the people were hopeful that TS Singh Deo would be made Congress Chief Minister and they voted one-sided for the party giving 14 out of 14 seats to the Congress. However, Congress went ahead with Bhupesh Baghel as CM, thus disappointing the region. The disappointment was such that even TS Singh Deo lost from his home turf Ambikapur in this year's election. During campaigning, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had urged people to make Vishnu Deo Sai win the polls and he would be made a big man. छत्तीसगढ़ में CM तय...अब किसको 'भय' ?#Deshhit #ChattisgarhCM #Election2023 #BJP #ZeeNews@priyasi90 @ashwinipande @Tyagiji0744 @Zeepramod pic.twitter.com/b1h26iEZEy — Zee News (@ZeeNews) December 10, 2023 The Sarguja region voted for the BJP this year giving the saffron party all 14 seats. The BJP won 54 of the 90 seats while the Congress won just 35 seats. Had the 14 seats gone to the Congress once again this year just like in 2018, Congress would have formed government once again with 49 seats while BJP would have fallen short once again with just 40 seats. Now, by making a tribal Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, the BJP has not only fulfilled the ambitions of the Sarguja people but now maintains an edge over Congress in adjoining areas of Madya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha which houses a sizeable tribal population. This becomes even more important given the 2024 Lok Sabha polls which is just five months away. Also, by making Arun Sao and Vijay Sharma Deputy Chief Ministers, the BJP has played a safe card to keep its OBC andBrahmin votes intact. Raman Singh as speaker of the assembly will thwart any probability of dissent or rebellion while keeping the Rajput voters happy.

These have a total of 14 assembly seats. In most of the elections, Sarguja electorates vote in a pattern. In 2003, the BJP had got 10 seats while the Congress had got just four. In 2008, the BJP got nine and five went to the Congress while in 2013, both the BJP and the Congress got seven each. In the 2018 assembly elections, the people were hopeful that TS Singh Deo would be made Congress Chief Minister and they voted one-sided for the party giving 14 out of 14 seats to the Congress. However, Congress went ahead with Bhupesh Baghel as CM, thus disappointing the region. The disappointment was such that even TS Singh Deo lost from his home turf Ambikapur in this year's election. During campaigning, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had urged people to make Vishnu Deo Sai win the polls and he would be made a big man. छत्तीसगढ़ में CM तय...अब किसको 'भय' ?#Deshhit #ChattisgarhCM #Election2023 #BJP #ZeeNews@priyasi90 @ashwinipande @Tyagiji0744 @Zeepramod pic.twitter.com/b1h26iEZEy — Zee News (@ZeeNews) December 10, 2023 The Sarguja region voted for the BJP this year giving the saffron party all 14 seats. The BJP won 54 of the 90 seats while the Congress won just 35 seats. Had the 14 seats gone to the Congress once again this year just like in 2018, Congress would have formed government once again with 49 seats while BJP would have fallen short once again with just 40 seats. Now, by making a tribal Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, the BJP has not only fulfilled the ambitions of the Sarguja people but now maintains an edge over Congress in adjoining areas of Madya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha which houses a sizeable tribal population. This becomes even more important given the 2024 Lok Sabha polls which is just five months away. Also, by making Arun Sao and Vijay Sharma Deputy Chief Ministers, the BJP has played a safe card to keep its OBC andBrahmin votes intact. Raman Singh as speaker of the assembly will thwart any probability of dissent or rebellion while keeping the Rajput voters happy.

On December 6, senior advocate Dushyant Dave wrote an open letter addressed to the CJI, expressing anguish over ""certain happenings"" related to the listing of cases and their reallocation to other benches of the apex court and sought immediate corrective measures. Trending Photos NEW DELHI: Bar Council of India (BCI) Chairman Manan Kumar Mishra has written to Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud voicing concerns about a recent open letter from a senior lawyer to the CJI over the listing of sensitive cases pending before the Supreme Court and said this was an attempt to create ""undue influence"" and get ""favourable"" decisions. On December 6, senior advocate Dushyant Dave wrote an open letter addressed to the CJI, expressing anguish over ""certain happenings"" related to the listing of cases and their reallocation to other benches of the apex court and sought immediate corrective measures. Without naming Dave, the BCI chairman said attempts made through such letters clearly amount to contemptuous conduct and a mischief perpetrated to further ulterior motives and must be tackled with iron hands. ""The letter in question is not an isolated incident, rather is a classic ploy from the handbook which has been tried time and again before almost every Chief Justice of India in the recent past. Such letters are an extra-judicial mechanism of creating undue influence and pressure in the functioning of the independent judicial system.... ""The claims made in the letter are in order to attract cheap publicity without an iota of truth and is completely devoid of any bona-fide purpose,"" Mishra wrote in his letter to the CJI. He alleged that the purpose behind such letters is to put pressure on the judiciary for getting ""favourable decisions for their influential clients and interests. Such letters have now become a regular feature almost to the point of staleness and must, therefore, be summarily rejected by Your Lordships"". ""It is our belief that such letters represent no part of the common members of the Bar practising before the courts and the entire Bar stands firmly behind the leadership and the direction of the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India. The tireless efforts of our Chief Justice of India today towards access to justice, towards protecting the interest of young and common advocates and towards rationalising the administration of justice have already started yielding the result,"" he wrote. Mishra requested the CJI to stamp out the ""nuisance"" that these letters seek to create and set a lasting precedent against such attempts. ""The council stands firmly with Your Lordships and requests Your Lordship and the judiciary to stand in one voice against such attempts, which have clearly been made with ulterior motives. Unity is strength and, therefore, on behalf of the entire legal fraternity, the Bar Council expresses its full support to our dynamic, most deserving/competent, bold and impartial Chief Justice of India, Hon'ble Dr D Y Chandrachud. The Bar fully stands with our beloved Chief Justice of India,"" he said. A day before Dave's letter, Supreme Court judge Sanjay Kishan Kaul had expressed surprise when some lawyers, including Prashant Bhushan, alleged a sudden deletion from court number two's cause list pleas related to the Centre's alleged delay in acting on the collegium's recommendations on elevation and transfer of high court judges. In his letter to the CJI, Dave, a former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president, had said he was deeply anguished at certain happenings related to the listing of cases by the apex court registry. He had added that some cases were sensitive in nature involving ""human rights, freedom of speech, democracy and the functioning of statutory and constitutional institutions"".

Sharing the photo on Twitter, the Congress party took a jib at Shah saying BJP's Chanakya is playing chess by pitting white against white, rather than a white vs black battle. Trending Photos In the heart of India's bustling political arena, the Congress party took a jab at Union Home Minister Amit Shah after the BJP stalwart shared a photo of him playing chess on Instagram. It all began when Amit Shah, known for his political manoeuvres, shared a photo on Instagram with the caption ""Don't settle for a good move, look for the better one."" Sharing the photo on X (formerly Twitter), the Congress party took a jib at Shah saying BJP's Chanakya is playing chess by pitting white against white, rather than a white vs black battle. ""Chanakya Amit Shah playing chess by pitting White against White. So cute photo ops!"" said Kerala Congress. The caption, ""So cute photo ops!"" was intended to ridicule Shah's strategic messaging. However, Twitter added a reader's context to the Kerala Congress's post shedding light on the intricacies of chess pieces. They clarified that in chess, the pieces often aren't strictly black and white but rather distinct shades, typically light and dark colours. It noted the nuanced difference in the hues of the pieces in Shah's photo: one side was slightly yellowish-white, the other a purer white. While Congress may have thought to ridicule Shah for the photo, the attempt left the party in a bad light. The Congress party's dig comes at a time when the grand old party suffered a humiliating defeat in the recently held assembly polls of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The netizens even asked Congress to focus on winning polls rather than indulging in this type of whataboutery.

It noted the nuanced difference in the hues of the pieces in Shah's photo: one side was slightly yellowish-white, the other a purer white. While Congress may have thought to ridicule Shah for the photo, the attempt left the party in a bad light. The Congress party's dig comes at a time when the grand old party suffered a humiliating defeat in the recently held assembly polls of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The netizens even asked Congress to focus on winning polls rather than indulging in this type of whataboutery.

Trending Photos The BJP may have a key breakthrough in Chhattisgarh where the party registered a surprise victory against Congress. Since the announcement of election results on December 3, the party has failed to pick up a Chief Ministerial candidate with multiple contenders vying for the post. The BJP appointed observers for the state earlier this week to ensure that no factional feud takes place within the party. The three observers are Union Ministers Arjun Munda, Sarbananda Sonowal and party general secretary Dushyant Gautam. The legislative party meeting will take place around 2pm and a decision is likely by this evening. According to reports, the BJP may go for an OBC or a tribal chief minister if it doesn't pick party stalwart Raman Singh, who served as CM thrice from 2003 to 2018. The move to pick an OBC or tribal CM is part of the BJP's strategy for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Among the key potentical CM candidates are Vishnu Deo, Renuka Singh, state BJP chief Arun Sao, Gomti Sai, who resigned as MPs after being elected as an MLA, former state ministers Ramvichar Netam and Lata Usendi, and bureaucrat-turned-politician O P Choudhary.

Trending Photos BHOPAL: In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP awaits the high command's 'googly' as the race for the Chief Minister's post hots up. Amid speculation around who will become the Chief Minister in Madhya Pradesh, there is a chance that the BJP is likely to choose a new face for the CM's post. The BJP won 163 out of the 230 Assembly seats in the state and six days have passed since the results were announced, but the decision on who will get the top job is still pending. As is the case with the party, the BJP went to the polls without a CM face. Now, after winning the elections, the BJP has appointed three observers, who are scheduled to arrive in Bhopal on Sunday, and a meeting of the legislative party is planned for Monday. Meanwhile, a series of meetings among several contenders for the top job are being held in the BJP. Whether it is in Delhi or Bhopal, leaders are networking and lobbying hard.

Posters supporting Tomar have already been put up in Gwalior, while some legislators are also projecting Prahlad Patel as a potential Chief Minister. Even though hectic lobbying is going on behind the scenes, none of the contenders for the top job are openly declaring that they see themselves as the future Chief Minister of the state. Significantly, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and State President Vishnu Dutt Sharma have already announced that they are stepping out of the race for the Chief Minister's chair. Political analysts believe that the BJP in Madhya Pradesh might throw a 'googly' in the form of a candidate who has not been discussed, predicted or anticipated by anyone. What the party high command does in the end, only time will tell. As is the case with the party, the BJP went to the polls without a CM face.

The accused, operating on the directions of their foreign handlers, had been actively involved in various terrorist activities, including the fabrication of IEDs, for furthering the violent and destructive agenda of ISIS, as per NIA investigations. Huge amounts of unaccounted cash, firearms, sharp-edged weapons, incriminating documents, smartphones and other digital devices were seized during the raids, conducted as part of NIA’s ongoing efforts to disrupt and demolish the attempts of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to carry out violent acts of terror and take innocent lives. The seizures included one pistol, two air guns, eight swords/knives, two laptops, six hard disks, three CDs, 38 mobile phones, 10 magazine books, Rs 68,03,800 in cash and 51 Hamas flags. NIA investigations have revealed that the accused, all members of the ISIS Maharashtra module, were operating from Padgha-Borivali, where they had hatched the conspiracy to spread terror and violence across India. Pursuing the path of violent Jihad, Khilafat, ISIS etc., the accused had aimed to disturb the peace and communal harmony of the country and to wage a war against the Government of India. Initial investigations have revealed that the arrested accused had self-declared the village of Padgha in rural Thane as a ‘liberated zone’ and as ‘Al Sham’. They were motivating impressionable Muslim youth to relocate to Padgha from their place of residence to strengthen the Padgha base. Mohd. Saquib Abdul Hamid Nachan aka Raveesh aka Saquib aka Khalid, the main accused and the self-declared leader of the arrested persons, had self-assumed the rights of administering ‘bayath’ (oath of alliance towards the Khalifa of ISIS) to the persons joining the proscribed organisation.

By: एबीपी लाइव | Updated at : 11 Dec 2023 12:16 AM (IST) सुप्रीम कोर्ट (फाइल फोटो) ( Image Source : PTI ) Supreme Court: सुप्रीम कोर्ट की संवैधानिक पीठ सोमवार (11 दिसंबर) को अनुच्छेद 370 को निरस्त करने और जम्मू-कश्मीर को दो केंद्र शासित प्रदेशों में विभाजित करने को चुनौती देने वाली याचिकाओं पर अपना फैसला सुनाएगी. सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने 16 दिनों की बहस के बाद 5 सितंबर को फैसला सुरक्षित रख लिया था. भारत के मुख्य न्यायाधीश डीवाई चंद्रचूड़, न्यायमूर्ति संजय किशन कौल, न्यायमूर्ति संजीव खन्ना, बीआर गवई और न्यायमूर्ति सूर्यकांत की पांच न्यायाधीशों की संविधान पीठ सोमवार को यह फैसला सुनाएगी. अटॉर्नी जनरल आर वेंकटरमाणी, सॉलिसिटर जनरल तुषार मेहता, वरिष्ठ अधिवक्ता हरीश साल्वे, राकेश द्विवेदी, वी गिरी और अन्य ने अनुच्छेद 370 को निरस्त करने ने कोर्ट में केंद्र सरकार के फैसले की पैरवी की. वहीं, याचिकाकर्ताओं की ओर से कपिल सिब्बल, गोपाल सुब्रमण्यम, राजीव धवन, जफर शाह, दुष्यंत दवे और अन्य वरिष्ठ अधिवक्ताओं ने अपनी दलीलें पेश कीं. सुप्रीम कोर्ट में विस्तार हुई बहस इस दौरान वकीलों ने 5 अगस्त 2019 को केंद्र के अनुच्छेद 370 को निरस्त करने के केंद्र के फैसले की संवैधानिक वैधता, जम्मू कश्मीर पुनर्गठन अधिनियम की वैधता, राज्यपाल और राष्ट्रपति शासन को चुनौती और राष्ट्रपति शासन के विस्तार सहित विभिन्न मुद्दों पर बहस की. गौरतलब है कि अनुच्छेद 370 को निरस्त करने और जम्मू-कश्मीर पुनर्गठन अधिनियम 2019 को चुनौती देने वाली कई याचिकाएं 2019 में संविधान पीठ को भेजी गईं थीं. सुनवाई के दौरान सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने पूछा कि जब जम्मू-कश्मीर में कोई संविधान सभा मौजूद नहीं हो तो क्या उसकी सहमति ऐसा कदम उठाने से पहले जरूरी होती है औरअनुच्छेद 370 को हटाने की सिफारिश कौन कर सकता है? सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने यह भी पूछा कि एक प्रावधान (अनुच्छेद 370), जिसे विशेष रूप से संविधान में अस्थायी के रूप में उल्लेखित किया गया था. वह 1957 में जम्मू कश्मीर संविधान सभा का कार्यकाल समाप्त होने के बाद स्थायी कैसे हो सकता है? केंद्र ने अपने बचाव में क्या कहा?केंद्र सरकार ने कोर्ट में कहा कि अनुच्छेद 370 को निरस्त करना संवैधानिक फ्रॉड नहीं था . इसे कानूनी ढांचे के अनुरूप हटाया गया था. केंद्र ने तर्क दिया कि जम्मू कश्मीर का भारत में विलय अन्य रियासतों की तरह एक प्रक्रिया से हुआ था. केंद्र सरकार ने कहा कि केंद्र शासित प्रदेश के रूप में जम्मू-कश्मीर की वर्तमान स्थिति अस्थायी है और वह राज्य का दर्जा बहाल करने के लिए प्रतिबद्ध है. इस दौरान सरकार ने हिंसा में गिरावट का हवाला दिया और कहा कि अनुच्छेद 370 हटने के बाद वहां सकारात्मक परिवर्तन हुआ है. याचिकाकर्ताओं का तर्कयाचिकाकर्ताओं ने तर्क दिया कि अनुच्छेद 370, जिसे शुरू में अस्थायी माना गया था, वह जम्मू-कश्मीर की संविधान सभा के विघटन के बाद स्थायी हो गया था. उन्होंने यह भी तर्क दिया कि संसद के पास अनुच्छेद 370 को निरस्त करने के लिए खुद को जम्मू-कश्मीर की विधायिका घोषित करने का अधिकार नहीं है. याचिकाकर्ताओं ने अनुच्छेद 370 के क्लाउज 3 का जिक्र करते हुए कहा कि इसे हटाने के लिए संविधान सभा की सिफारिश महत्वपूर्ण थी. संविधान सभा की मंजूरी के बिना इसे निरस्त नहीं किया जा सकता. जम्मू कश्मीर हाई कोर्ट बार एसोसिएशन का रुखजम्मू कश्मीर हाई कोर्ट बार एसोसिएशन ने सुप्रीम कोर्ट में कहा कि भारत में शामिल होने पर जम्मू कश्मीर के महाराजा ने राज्य पर क्षेत्रीय संप्रभुता बरकरार रखी, लेकिन उनके पास संप्रभुता नहीं थी. हालांकि रक्षा, विदेश मामले और संचार, कानून और शासन के लिए अन्य सभी शक्तियां केंद्र के पास थीं. यह भी पढ़ें- 'संदिग्ध विदेशियों को जमीन न बेचें,' सीएम हिमंत बिस्व सरमा ने असमवासियों से की अपील EZC Meet: एक साथ नजर आए नीतीश कुमार और अमित शाह, पटना में पूर्वी क्षेत्रीय परिषद की बैठक में किन मुद्दों पर हुई चर्चा?

'कांग्रेस की फितरत भ्रष्टाचार'गृह मंत्री ने कहा कि कांग्रेस की तो फितरत ही सदैव भ्रष्टाचार की रही है, लेकिन इस पर तृणमूल कांग्रेस, जेडीयू , आरजेडी और डीएमके सहित सभी दल खामोश बैठे हुए. अब मुझे समझ आ रहा कि पीएम मोदी के खिलाफ एजेंसियों के दुरुपयोग का प्रचार अभियान चला, वह इसलिए चला क्योंकि उनको अपने कच्चे-चिट्ठे खुलने का डर था. 'सभी दलों को देना चाहिए जवाब'उन्होंने कहा कि झारखंड जैसे गरीब राज्य में इस तरह का भ्रष्टाचार आंखे खोलने वाला है. इतना भ्रष्टाचार होने पर अगर कोई एजेंसी काम न करे तो उसकी क्षमता पर सवाल उठते हैं. मेरा मानना है कि कांग्रेस सहित सभी इंडी दलों को इसका जवाब देना चाहिए. इस दौरान गृह मंत्री ने कहा, ""बीजेपी इस मसले को जन-जन तक ले जाएगी और जागरुकता लाने की कोशिश करेगी. 2014 से हमारी लड़ाई करप्शन के खिलाफ है और इसके खिलाफ मोदी सरकार ने कई कदम उठाए हैं."" अब तक 318 करोड़ की नकदी जब्तगौरतलब है कि आयकर विभाग की ओर से कांग्रेस नेता और राज्यसभा सांसद धीरज साहू से जुड़े ओडिशा और झारखंड के कई ठिकानों पर की गई छापेमारी की गई. आईटी ने अब तक 318 करोड़ रुपये से अधिक की नकदी बरामद कर ली है. यह भी पढ़ें- आदिवासी वोटर्स ने किया छत्तीसगढ़ में 'खेला' तो बीजेपी ने विष्णु देव साय को बना दिया सीएम, आंकड़े दे रहे गवाही EZC Meet: एक साथ नजर आए नीतीश कुमार और अमित शाह, पटना में पूर्वी क्षेत्रीय परिषद की बैठक में किन मुद्दों पर हुई चर्चा?

A fascinating member of Telangana cabinet is Maoist-turned-MLA Danasari Anasuya, popularly known as Seethakka, whom Chief Minister Revanth Reddy calls his ""sister"". As someone who took up arms and renounced it, Seethakka's mission is to arm youngsters with access to education, so they can rewrite their future.

The 52-year-old tribal MLA from Mulugu has been entrusted with three crucial ministries -- panchayat raj, rural development and women & child welfare. Born to labourer parents, Seethakka had joined the Maoist movement when she was barely 14 -- long before she finished school. Over the years, she rose to become Seethakka, a commandant in the extremist group, went to jail, and then gave it all up in 1997. When in the movement, she gave birth to a son whom she and her husband had to give up. Those underground are not allowed to raise children. Her mother later traced the child and brought him up herself. Later Seethakka gave up the Left extremist movement and parted ways with her husband over ""ideological differences"". ""I studied law... argued in same court where I stood as accused once,"" Seethakka told NDTV. She earned her Ph.D from Osmania University in October last year and recently sat for her LLM exam.

The counting involved nine teams of about 80 people from the tax department. The cash seizure in the income-tax department's searches against an Odisha-based distillery company, owned by a Congress MP's family, has been calculated at Rs 351 crore after five days of counting and is the ""highest-ever"" haul in a single action by any probe agency in the country, official sources said on Sunday. The premises of the Congress Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand, Dhiraj Prasad Sahu, in Ranchi and other places, were also covered during the searches by the department. The company and the member of Parliament did not respond to PTI's queries regarding the action being carried out against them. The marathon raids against Boudh Distillery Private Limited, its promoters and others entered the fifth day on Sunday. The raids were launched on December 6 by the taxman on charges of tax evasion and ""off-the-book"" transactions. The sources told PTI that Rs 351 crore cash has been counted and the process has ended. The counting involved nine teams of about 80 people from the tax department and various banks, working in shifts in a 24x7 cycle. Another team of 200 officials, including security personnel, drivers and other staff, joined in after the taxman found 10 almirahs stuffed with cash apart from some other locations. As many as 200 bags and trunks were used to transport the cash for depositing it in various bank branches in Odisha, the sources said. The department believes that the entire cache of currency is ""unaccounted"" money earned from cash sales of country liquor by the business group, distributors and others. It is the highest-ever cash seizure made by an agency in the country as part of an action against a single group and entities linked to it, the sources had said. Some of the high-value seizures in the past include one from 2019 when the GST Intelligence raided a Kanpur-based businessman and seized cash amounting to Rs 257 crore and another instance where cash amounting to Rs 163 crore was unearthed by the I-T department during searches against a road construction firm in Tamil Nadu in July 2018. The department is also recording the statements of the executives and other staff who were present at the searched locations and will soon issue summonses to the main promoters of the company for recording their statements. It was not clear what amount of cash and other documents were seized from Mr Sahu's house. The maximum cache of currency, largely in Rs 500 denomination, was recovered from the premises of the company in Bolangir district, the sources said. The BJP on Sunday stepped up its attack on the Congress and other opposition parties, with Union Home Minister Amit Shah saying it is now clear that their ""propaganda"" about probe agencies being misused was driven by the fear that their corruption will be exposed. In a statement, the senior BJP leader questioned the ""silence"" of INDIA bloc leaders, saying he can understand why the Congress is keeping mum but wondered why parties like the TMC, DMK, JD(U) and the RJD were doing the same. While the Congress has distanced itself from the MP, claiming that the party has nothing to do with his business, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah accused the Centre of targeting only the Congress and asked why no searches were carried out against BJP leaders. Jharkhand Congress in-charge Avinash Pandey said, ""Since he is Congress MP, he should make an official statement about how such a big amount of money came to him."" Union Tourism Minister and BJP leader G Kishan Reddy asked why Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was ""silent"" on the issue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on Friday assured the people that the money looted from the public will be returned and had posted a Hindi newspaper report where the cash recovered by the IT department was shown stacked. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Taking to X, he had said, ""The countrymen should look at the pile of these notes and then listen to the honest speeches' of their leaders ...Whatever has been looted from the public, every penny will have to be returned, this is Modi's guarantee.""

Rajasthan | Gehlot's lessons in profligacy,https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/nation/story/20230925-rajasthan-ashok-gehlots-lessons-in-profligacy-2436050-2023-09-15?utm_source=rss,"Fri, 15 Sep 2023 17:38:30+05:30",N/A,"Rajasthan | Gehlot's lessons in profligacy Thousands of crores have been spent on cosmetic touches in Rajasthan's Kota. A chic new riverfront is the latest addition to that frenzied beautification, though it has landed in a controversy over allegedly flouting environmental norms. Amid criticism, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot decided to distance himself from the inauguration. But can he justify the wanton spending on other projects? A helical clover bridge sounds like a sleek thing right out of some First World xanadu. This one, built at a cost of Rs 42 crore, is in Rajasthan’s Kota, but it soars and twists balletically too, for about a kilometre, except that it lands a few metres from where it started. Even more mystifyingly, it soars over nothing: there’s no crossing or rail track or any form of obstruction underneath. Just a few minutes away, along the Chambal, a new riverfront was inaugurated with great pomp on September 12—a costly façade laid end-to-end over three kilometres of natural rock and soil like a pink stone shroud, leaving not even parts of the riverbed, let alone a scrap of greenery. In its place have come up 26 spanking new ghats strung along imitation Rajputana architectural chic. Turrets and chhatris in the local Hadauti style. An army of giant statues, one of which, a 25-feet Yogimudra, vanishes when you see it straight on. Another curiosity is both visible and audible: the world’s largest bell whose boom, they say, can be heard eight kilometres away and, coming in at 82 tonnes on the scale, is no bantamweight either. Goddess Chambal, a deity who’s considered cursed and hence is rarely worshipped, also gets a 242-feet-high statue of Vietnamese marble here. The riverfront is studded liberally with replicas that stand like displaced metaphors, such as a highrise Red Fort or the Chinese Pagoda. Add a proposed boat cruise, a water park, a train on tyres, golf carts, skating area, the world’s second-largest musical fountain, cafes, restaurants, a commercial complexâ€æ in short, it’s the full fairground cornucopia. Kota (North) MLA and Rajasthan urban development minister Shanti Dhariwal, whose brainchild this frenzied beautification is, wanted to outdo the Kashi Corridor and the Sabarmati riverfront and take Kota right into the elite club of Paris and London. Dumb-struck critics call it the “world’s only copycat heritage waterfront”."

Since 2016, around 58 ‘Maratha Kranti Morchas’—some of them having hundreds of thousands of people joining them—were organised in Maharashtra and neighbouring states. The agitation turned violent in 2018, further beleaguering the then Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Shiv Sena coalition. There was speculation that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which has a strong base among the Marathas and was then in the Opposition, had fuelled these protests to corner Fadnavis, a Brahmin. However, the Maratha protests saw counter-mobilisation by the non-Marathas, especially by the upwardly mobile other backward classes (OBCs), who felt that the Marathas would eventually eat into their 27 per cent share of reservations. These groups organised ‘Bahujan Kranti Morchas’ across the state on similar lines."

Half the order is complete but we are working late into the evenings to get the rest ready,” says Kabeer, whose unit is the only one in the Valley to meet ICC (International Cricket Council) specifications for cricket bats. Cricketers from three teams—Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan—will be playing the ICC one-day international cricket World Cup in October with bats produced by his company, which goes by the modish name GR8 Sports. “It is a proud moment for our industry,” says Kabeer. “For the first time, bats from our unit will be used in an ODI World Cup.

Xi’s skipping of G20 Summit may have more to do with China than with India,https://www.indiatoday.in/nation/story/xi-jinping-g20-summit-delhi-not-attending-due-to-political-china-economy-political-troubles-military-purge-2432412-2023-09-07?utm_source=rss,"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 16:30:23+05:30",N/A,"Xi’s skipping of G20 Summit may have more to do with China than with India Chinese President Xi Jinping is giving a miss to G20 Summit in New Delhi. But if experts are to be believed, it might have more to do with Xi's economic and political problems at home than China's friction with India. Listen to Story Chinese President Xi Jinping was born in the lap of luxury but, as his father was purged during China’s Cultural Revolution, a young Xi had to toil in the farms as a manual labourer in the countryside for 6 years. Those struggles would be nothing compared to the task the all-supreme leader now faces. Xi is skipping the G20 Summit in New Delhi and experts have failed to pin-point the one big reason why China is sending Premier Li Qiang instead. It is true that China’s relationship with India has been mostly frosty since the border clashes in May 2020. And it is also possible that the Chinese government decided to send Premier Li Qiang instead of President Xi to send out a signal. But the Chinese government has maintained that it was ready to work with all the parties for the global event's success in New Delhi this week. Also, Xi might not want to share the stage with the “tough crowd” at the G20. Many G20 member countries have “hardened their positions on China” in the last decade, said Paul Haenle, director of think-tank Carnegie China, adding, “It’s a tough crowd for Xi”. What experts are also hinting at is that Xi Jinping’s skipping the India-hosted G20 event could be due to the mounting troubles in China itself. So, is Xi staying back home where the real trouble is? Given Xi's focus on domestic issues, he might be unwilling to travel abroad, Alfred Wu, said associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. “Xi Jinping is setting his own agenda where his top concern is national security and he has to stay in China and make foreign leaders visit him instead,” Wu told Reuters. Wu says the over-emphasis on security is hurting China’s diplomatic ties and the attempt to rejuvenate its economy. China’s economy is in bad shape, and it is among Xi’s biggest headaches.HOUSING CRISIS HITS CHINA’S ECONOMY It seems the Chinese economy hasn’t emerged entirely from the Covid blow. It is the first time in decades that China’s economy is facing pressures from multiple fronts, to an extent that the entire world is jittery. Compared to last year, Chinese households are spending less, factories are producing less, and businesses are investing more slowly. Exports have slumped too. In August, China's exports dropped 8.8 per cent year-on-year and its imports contracted 7.3 per cent. advertisementDue to the sharp increase in youth unemployment, Beijing decided to stop disclosing the data. In the meantime, property prices are falling and some major developers have declared bankruptcy, putting the real estate sector in danger.The current economic obstacles that China faces have the potential to create a lethal mix that might spell the conclusion of its 40-year-long successful growth model. Economists say that China’s overdependence on the property sector for years coupled with its stringent Covid-related policy has significantly hampered its economic growth.Economists have always flagged China's debt-fuelled growth. It is seeing an astronomical rise in debt. China’s total debt-to-GDP ratio stood at a record 279 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, according to a Bloomberg analysis.Beijing appears to have paid a significant price for too much infrastructure spending over the years in the form of huge debt, and the housing bubble has already burst during the epidemic, beginning with the Evergrande catastrophe.The bigger fear is the contagion to the financial market. Twenty-five per cent of China’s economy is dependent on its property market.To compound Xi’s woes, big foreign brands that solely depend on China for manufacturing are diversifying operations under their China+1 strategy.

Xi is still worried about corruption in the ranks and has signalled that absolute loyalty [to the party] has not yet been achieved,” Lyle Morris, a foreign policy and national security expert at the Asia Society Policy Institute told the BBC.Then there was the surprise removal of Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang, a Xi confidant and the youngest to be appointed to that post, in July.No reason was given for Qin’s sudden removal and bringing back of his predecessor Wang Yi but it was seen as a failure on Xi’s part.“Since both moves are attributed to China's leader [Xi Jinping], this episode will be seen as an embarrassing lapse in judgment at the top,” Daniel Russel of the Asia Society Policy Institute told the BBC.

A special urgency to tend to the general weal seems to grip the Rajasthan chief minister especially before elections—a time such as now. Whether born of principle or exigency, this bent continues to give Rajasthan some pioneering policy moments. Back in 2011, during his second term, the Free Medicine Scheme was one such. More than an unthinking handout, it was an intervention that answered to a historical need, at a time when increasingly privatised healthcare was bleeding the mass of immiserated citizenry. Crafted around the procurement of generic medicines, it helped break the tyranny of huge mark-ups on branded drugs. Now, the budget session of 2023 brings forth two pieces of legislation that can have a similar historic stature in India, enacted as a response to the way the evolving economy is experienced at the bottom of the pyramid: the Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Bill, and the Minimum Income Guarantee Act."
