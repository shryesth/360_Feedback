West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will lead a ‘rally for harmony’ on January 22 from Hazra Crossing in south Kolkata to Park Circus, where she will also address a public meeting. Trending Photos New Delhi: West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar on Friday appealed to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to announce a holiday on January 22 so that the people of the state can join the festivities of the Ram temple consecration ceremony in Ayodhya. The central government offices, public sector banks, insurance companies, financial institutions and regional rural banks (RRBs) in the country will be closed for half a day on January 22. Some states, such as Assam and Odisha, which are neighbouring West Bengal, have also declared a half-day holiday for the occasion. Majumdar shared a letter he sent to the chief minister on X, saying “I have requested our Hon’ble CM @MamataOfficial (Mamata Banerjee) to kindly consider declaring 22nd January 2024 to be a school holiday, so that the youth of West Bengal gets to rejoice in the Ram Mandir consecration celebrations.” I have requested our Hon'ble CM @MamataOfficial to kindly consider declaring 22nd January, 2024 to be a school holiday, so that the youth of West Bengal gets to rejoice in the Ram Mandir consecration celebrations...#RamMandirPranPratishta #RamMandir pic.twitter.com/h4U4TagCKZ — Dr. Sukanta Majumdar (@DrSukantaBJP) January 19, 2024 He mentioned that the chief minister has given holidays for many special events in the past. He added, “We think that the people of the state should also get the opportunity to participate in the Ram Temple inauguration. We request you to officially declare the day as a holiday.” The TMC leadership, however, expressed doubt over the significance of the date for the Ram temple inauguration. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh asked, “Is there any specific date in the almanac or any other Hindu religious calendar where the auspicious date for Ram Temple inauguration is mentioned? Has Sukanta Majumdar become a priest? The event (Ram Temple inauguration) where many BJP leaders will be present is a political event before the Lok Sabha elections. We don’t mix religion with politics like the BJP.” Banerjee, who is also the head of the ruling TMC, will lead a ‘rally for harmony’ on January 22 from Hazra Crossing in south Kolkata to Park Circus, where she will also address a public meeting. She will begin the all-faith march after offering ‘puja’ at the ancient Kalighat temple, and visit places of worship of different religions along the way.

We request you to officially declare the day as a holiday.” The TMC leadership, however, expressed doubt over the significance of the date for the Ram temple inauguration. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh asked, “Is there any specific date in the almanac or any other Hindu religious calendar where the auspicious date for Ram Temple inauguration is mentioned? Has Sukanta Majumdar become a priest? The event (Ram Temple inauguration) where many BJP leaders will be present is a political event before the Lok Sabha elections. We don’t mix religion with politics like the BJP.” Banerjee, who is also the head of the ruling TMC, will lead a ‘rally for harmony’ on January 22 from Hazra Crossing in south Kolkata to Park Circus, where she will also address a public meeting. She will begin the all-faith march after offering ‘puja’ at the ancient Kalighat temple, and visit places of worship of different religions along the way.

From business magnate Mukesh Ambani to Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan, the guest list reads like a who's who of India's elite. A Star-Studded Affair The select list, carefully curated from a pool of about 8,000 invitees, boasts the presence of luminaries from various fields.

Joining him from the film fraternity are acclaimed actors Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar, Allu Arjun, Mohanlal, Anupam Kher, and Chiranjeevi. The musical realm will be represented by sarod maestro Amjad Ali and the power duo of lyricists Manoj Muntashir and Prasoon Joshi.

Captains Of Industry And Tycoons Gracing The Occasion Mukesh Ambani, accompanied by his esteemed family—Kokilaben, Neeta, Akash, Anant, daughter-in-law Shloka, and future daughter-in-law Radhika Merchant—will be among the distinguished attendees. The guest list further extends to titans of industry, including Aditya Birla Group's Kumar Mangalam Birla, Piramal Group's Ajay Piramal, Anand Mahindra of Mahindra and Mahindra, Zee Entertainment Enterprises CEO Punit Goenka and Ajay Shriram of DCM Shriram.

The list also features a touch of sportsmanship with Indian Women Cricket captain Mitali Raj. Ahead of the much-anticipated 'Pran Pratistha' ceremony on January 22, the Ram Temple Trust authorities have unveiled the first divine look of the Ram Lalla's idol that will be installed in the sanctum-sanctorum of the grand temple being built in Ayodhya. Crafted by the skilled hands of Mysuru-based artist Arun Yogiraj, the 51-inch Ram Lalla idol, carved from black stone, portrays Lord Ram as a five-year-old child standing tall with a golden bow and arrow. Unveiling The Divine Form In a meticulously orchestrated buildup to the consecration ceremony, the temple authorities gradually unveiled the idol over two days.

Today, they showcased the deity's face along with the gleaming golden bow and arrow, creating a moment of divine revelation. Divine Features And Symbolism The idol of Ram Lalla stands beneath a lotus, flanked by Lord Hanuman Ji on the right and Garuda Bhagwan on the left. In the days to come, the idol will also feature a bow in the left hand. A diamond-shaped representation on Ram Lalla's forehead is set to catch the devotees' eyes from a distance. Lord Surya's Reverence The positioning of the deity atop the idol honours Lord Surya, emphasizing Lord Ram's lineage in the Ikshvaku dynasty. The depiction pays homage to Lord Surya as the forefather of King Ikshvaku, establishing Lord Ram as a scion of the Solar Dynasty. Ten Incarnations Of Lord Vishnu The Ram Lalla idol incorporates representations of all ten ''avatars'' of Lord Vishnu. From Matsya to Kalki, the idol encapsulates the divine lineage and significance of Lord Ram within the broader context of Lord Vishnu's incarnations. Monumental Artistry Renowned sculptor Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka has masterfully crafted the 1800-kilogram Bal Swaroop idol. The meticulous details, including the first glimpse of Ram Lalla's face, have stirred waves of joy and devotion across the nation, with social media abuzz with shared images and prayers for the deity's blessings. Holiday Declared In Several States On Jan 22 Ahead of the 'Pran Pratistha' ceremony at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on January 22, the Central government has declared a half-day holiday for all its offices and institutions nationwide. This strategic move aims to allow employees to actively participate in the celebration of the auspicious event. Echoing similar sentiments, several states have also announced public holidays to mark this significant occasion. Countdown To Pran Pratishtha: Rituals In Ayodhya As Ayodhya prepares for the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony on January 22, the sacred rituals have entered their fourth day. The lighting of the ''holy fire'' marks the beginning of the day's ceremonies, with subsequent steps involving the establishment of 'Navagraha' and a 'Havan.' The idol of Shri Ram Lalla will undergo various rituals, including 'Aushdhadhiwas' and 'Kesaradhiwas,' culminating in the closing of temple doors until the grand ceremony. Tightened Security In Ayodhya With 'Pran Pratishtha' Day drawing near, security in Ayodhya's Karsevakpuram, where Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust General Secretary Champat Rai resides, has been intensified.

Bilkis Bano Case: Here`s What Supreme Court Said On Surrender Of All Convicts,https://zeenews.india.com/india/bilkis-bano-case-heres-what-supreme-court-said-on-surrender-of-all-convicts-2711329.html,"Friday, January 19, 2024, 15:22 GMT +5:30",Zee News,"Bilkis Bano Case: Here's What Supreme Court Said On Surrender Of All Convicts The top court has set a firm deadline for the 11 convicts involved in the Bilkis Bano case, requiring them to surrender before jail authorities by January 21. The top court has set a firm deadline for the 11 convicts involved in the Bilkis Bano case, requiring them to surrender before jail authorities by January 21. Trending Photos New Delhi: In a significant development, the Supreme Court, led by Justices BV Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan, unequivocally rejected the applications filed by the convicts involved in the Bilkis Bano gang rape case on Friday. The convicts had sought an extension of time to surrender before jail authorities, citing various reasons. No Merit In Reasons Cited By Convicts: SC The apex court, in its dismissal, asserted that the reasons presented by the convicts for seeking a postponement of surrender and a delay in reporting back to jail have no merit. Justices BV Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan emphasized that these reasons do not justify non-compliance with the court's directions. All miscellaneous applications have been summarily dismissed, and any pending applications stand disposed of. Convicts Must Surrender By January 21: SC The court has set a firm deadline for the 11 convicts involved in the Bilkis Bano case, requiring them to surrender before jail authorities by January 21. This decision comes after the convicts approached the apex court, citing health issues, caretaking responsibilities for aged parents, impending crop harvest, and other concerns. Background: Remission, Release, And Supreme Court Intervention Originally sentenced to life imprisonment for their involvement in the gangrape of Bilkis Bano and the murder of her family members during the 2002 Godhra riots, the convicts were granted remission by the Gujarat government. However, in a landmark decision on January 8, the Supreme Court struck down the remission order, declaring it invalid. The apex court held that the Gujarat government lacked the authority to pass remission orders and clarified that only the Maharashtra government was competent to do so. The court also expressed strong disapproval, stating that the previous judgment directing the Gujarat government to consider remission was obtained through fraud and the suppression of material facts. SC's Rebuke: Convicts Approached With 'Unclean Hands' The bench remarked that the convicts had not approached the court with ""clean hands,"" emphasizing that the proceedings were tainted by the ""suppression of facts,"" constituting a fraud on the court. The judgment came in response to a petition filed by Bilkis Bano and others challenging the premature release of the 11 convicts. Guj Govt's Defence Of Remission To Convicts Earlier, the Gujarat government defended the remission, arguing that the convicts had completed a 14-year sentence, and their behavior was deemed good. The Bilkis Bano case dates back to March 2002 during the post-Godhra riots when she was allegedly gang-raped, left to die with her family, and five months pregnant. The recent Supreme Court decision underscores the commitment to justice and adherence to legal processes in high-profile cases.

Himanta Biswa Sarma Vs Rahul Gandhi: Assam CM`s Journey From A Congress Loyalist To BJP`s Northeast Posterboy,https://zeenews.india.com/india/himanta-biswa-sarma-vs-rahul-gandhi-assam-cms-journey-from-a-congress-loyalist-to-bjps-northeast-posterboy-2711268.html,"Friday, January 19, 2024, 14:10 GMT +5:30",Zee News,"Himanta Biswa Sarma Vs Rahul Gandhi: Assam CM's Journey From A Congress Loyalist To BJP's Northeast Posterboy Himanta Biswa Sarma was once a staunch Congress loyalist during the tenure of Tarun Gogoi, the then Chief Minister of Assam. Himanta Biswa Sarma was once a staunch Congress loyalist during the tenure of Tarun Gogoi, the then Chief Minister of Assam. Trending Photos NEW DELHI: Within 24 hours, Himanta Biswa Sarma and Rahul Gandhi have been engaged in a bitter war of words, revealing deep-rooted animosity. The catalyst for this verbal altercation was Rahul Gandhi's ongoing ""Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra"" in Assam, where he accused the Assam government of being the ''most corrupt'' in India. Sarma, in turn, fired back, alleging corruption within the Gandhi family. Once Allies, Now Foes Rewinding a few years, the political landscape was different. Himanta Biswa Sarma was a staunch Congress loyalist during the tenure of Tarun Gogoi, the then Chief Minister of Assam. Rise Of Himanta Biswa Sarma Around a decade ago, Assam witnessed elections that reshaped the political dynamics of the state. Tarun Gogoi, the incumbent Chief Minister, faced a formidable opponent in Sarma, who had already served as the Health Minister. However, Sarma's ambitions to secure the Chief Ministerial position were thwarted, leading to his eventual departure from the Congress party. Shift To BJP And Northeast's Political Landscape A year later, Sarma made a significant political shift by joining the BJP. His departure from Congress was marked by a scathing letter to Sonia Gandhi, criticizing Rahul Gandhi's inability to understand the importance of key issues in Assam. The move had significant repercussions, as it not only altered Sarma's political trajectory but also paved the way for BJP's influence in the Northeast. BJP's First Victory In Northeast Himanta Biswa Sarma's political journey became synonymous with BJP's triumph in the Northeast. His impact extended across all states in the region, solidifying BJP's presence. Reflecting on the 2016 victory in Assam, Sarma claimed to have forewarned Rahul Gandhi that Congress would lose 25 seats if things continued as they were. Strained Relations And Allegations In a candid interview with a leading news channel, Sarma expressed his views on Rahul Gandhi, stating that Gandhi was arrogant and failed to comprehend the intricacies of the issues faced by Assam. Sarma highlighted an incident where Gandhi was preoccupied with feeding biscuits to his dog during a crucial discussion on Assam's problems, garnering significant media attention. Exodus In Congress The Congress party has faced criticism for neglecting the aspirations of young leaders, a lapse that has not gone unnoticed. Unlike other states, where this oversight may not be as pronounced, the party witnessed a succession of young Congress leaders defecting to the BJP due to unfulfilled ambitions. The lack of interest in grooming leaders from the next generation within the Congress became apparent. Rise Of Young Leaders In BJP One after another, young Congress leaders found a new political home in the BJP as their aspirations were not being met within the Congress ranks. The trend gained momentum post the formation of the Modi government, indicating a significant shift in political allegiances. Critics argue that the Congress party failed to demonstrate interest in nurturing the next generation of leaders. This indifference became more evident as leaders started leaving the party, seeking opportunities elsewhere. The departure of Himanta Biswa Sarma marked the beginning of a trend that would continue, especially in the Northeast. Growing List of Defectors From Congress In the aftermath of Sarma's departure, the Congress party in the Northeast faced a series of defections. Notable leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasada, Sushmita Dev, Amarinder Singh, RPN Singh, Kapil Sibal, Sunil Jakhar, Gulam Nabi Azad, Jayveer Sherigill, among others, chose to leave the Congress fold. Himanata Sarma vs The Gandhi Family Recently, Himanta Biswa Sarma trained his guns at Rahul Gandhi, asserting that the Gandhi family is not just corrupt but also 'duplicates.' He emphasized that the family's surname is not Gandhi; rather, they go by the 'duplicate' moniker. Sarma, in the context of Rahul's political journey, suggested in 2022 that since India has remained intact while Pakistan has separated, Rahul Gandhi should embark on a similar journey to Pakistan. As political landscapes shift and alliances change, the rivalry between Himanta Biswa Sarma and Rahul Gandhi reflects the dynamic nature of Indian politics. The repercussions of this political turbulence extend beyond individual careers, impacting the larger narrative of regional and national politics.

'राजीव गांधी कभी भी ताले को खोलने की अनुमति नहीं देंगे' उन्होंने ताला खोले जाने के प्रकरण की विस्तार से चर्चा करते हुए कहा, ''ताला खोला गया और बड़ी संख्या में हिंदू तीर्थयात्री जो इकट्ठे हुए थे, जानबूझकर अंदर आ गए और राजीव को इसके बारे में कुछ भी नहीं पता था....ताले खोलने में कांग्रेस का हाथ था...उस कांग्रेसी को पता था कि राजीव गांधी कभी भी कार्यकारी आदेश को रद्द करके ताले को खोलने की अनुमति नहीं देंगे और इसीलिए उन्होंने इस बात को राजीव से दूर रखा.'' उनके मुताबिक, एक साल के अंदर ही राजीव गांधी को उन साजिशों का पता चल गया और बाद में अरुण नेहरू बीजेपी में शामिल हुए. 'कांग्रेस नेतृत्व तुच्छ राजनीति का हिस्सा नहीं बना' उन्होंने कहा कि ताला खोलने के लिए राजीव गांधी को नहीं, कांग्रेस को जिम्मेदार कहा जाना चाहिए. अय्यर का कहना था कि बतौर कांग्रेसी उनके लिए यह गर्व की बात है कि कांग्रेस नेतृत्व तुच्छ राजनीति का हिस्सा नहीं बना और प्राण प्रतिष्ठा समारोह का निमंत्रण अस्वीकार कर दिया. यह भी पढ़ें: 'इंडिया' गठबंधन में सीट बंटवारे में देरी के बीच मुलाकातों का दौर, बंगाल में ममता बनर्जी ने बढ़ाई कांग्रेस की टेंशन Bilkis Bano Case: 'बिलकिस बानो मामले के दोषी लापता नहीं', बोली गुजरात पुल‍िस आस्था की रोशनी से नहाया राम मंदिर, रामलला की भी आई तस्वीरें, किन राज्यों ने किया छुट्टी का ऐलान? रामलला की प्राण प्रतिष्ठा पर क्या कुछ बोले शारदा पीठ के शंकराचार्य स्वामी सदानंद महाराज?

""That (President's rule) is what we are expecting as it (violence) has gone on for very long. The situation does not change, and sometimes it becomes worse,"" Laldohuma told reporters at the 71st Plenary Session of the North East Council in Meghalaya's Shillong. ""There has to be a solution between the government of India, government of Manipur and tribal leaders,"" the newly elected Mizoram Chief Minister said, adding ""the buck stops at the Home Ministry"". Mizoram has sheltered hundreds of people from the Kuki tribes who have come from violence-hit Manipur, a state ruled by the BJP. ""The Indian Constitution provides that they can settle anywhere in the country. Unless normalcy returns to Manipur, we will look after them. Yes, it is the responsibility of the Home Ministry to intervene if there is trouble anywhere in the country,"" Lalduhoma said. ""There has to be a solution between the tribal leaders and the state government; it must be mediated by the Home Ministry. We have nothing to do, except to look after the people who are staying there,"" said the Mizoram Chief Minister who defeated Zoramthanga of the Mizo National Front (MNF) in the recent assembly election. On December 12, Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh had asked his Mizoram counterpart Lalduhoma not to interfere in the internal matters of Manipur, but rather give support in restoring peace. Citing comments by Lalduhoma on the Manipur ethnic tension between the hill-majority Kuki tribes and the valley-majority Meiteis, Mr Singh had said Lalduhoma must stop expressing views that are beyond his constitutional mandate. ""... A lot of communities have been living in (border town) Moreh. My earnest appeal to him is, please help us restore peace. I never commented when the Bru issue happened in Mizoram, so please pray and help us restore normalcy in Manipur,"" Mr Singh had said at an event in the honour of Nupi Lan (Women's War), a key historical event when the women of Manipur fought against the British twice - in 1904 and 1939. The Bru tribes have been living in relief camps in Tripura since 1997. They had fled their homeland Mizoram to reach the neighbouring state because of ethnic clashes. Lalduhoma earlier this month told External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar that he does not want the border with Myanmar to be fenced, according to a report by Deccan Herald. Mizoram has given shelter to over 35,000 refugees who came from Myanmar to escape the conflict between the junta forces and insurgents. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com In the meeting with the Foreign Minister in Delhi, Lalduhoma had said if the Centre builds fences along the Mizoram-Myanmar border, it would mean accepting the blunder committed by the British colonial government, which divided the Mizos living in both India and Myanmar. ""The Mizo people reject the proposal to fence the border,"" Lalduhoma reportedly told Mr Jaishankar. The comment was seen with concern in neighbouring Manipur, where the Meiteis have accused illegal immigrants from Myanmar crossing over to India over a matter of decades, and a huge network of drug traffickers fed by thousands of acres of poppy cultivation in the hills, as the core factors behind the violence that began on May 3, 2023.

""Given that there is so much potential in India, we need to rapidly build an aircraft manufacturing ecosystem in the country,"" PM Modi said. ""I proclaimed from the ramparts of the Red Fort - 'this is the time, this is the right time'. It is also the opportune time for Boeing and other international companies to align their growth with Bharat's rapid progress. The commitment of 140 crore Indians is now focused on building a developed Bharat in the next 25 years,"" PM Modi said. ""With such immense potential in Bharat, we must swiftly establish the aircraft manufacturing ecosystem. Bharat boasts a robust network of MSMEs and a vast talent pool. Coupled with a stable government and a policy approach that encourages 'Make in India', this creates a win-win situation for every sector. I believe that the people won't have to wait long for Boeing's first fully designed and manufactured aircraft in Bharat,"" the Prime Minister said. BIETC was built at a cost of Rs 1,600 crore on a 43-acre plot at Hightech Defence and Aerospace Park in Devanahalli, on the outskirts of Bengaluru. The facility is expected to become a cornerstone for partnerships with vibrant startups, and private and government ecosystem in India. Boeing did not give details on the number of people the new facility will employ. Boeing currently employs more than 6,000 people in India across its various centres. PM Modi also launched the Boeing Sukanya Programme that the company said aims to support the entry of more girl children from across India into the country's growing aviation sector. The programme will provide opportunities for girls and women from across India to learn critical skills in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and train for jobs in the aviation sector, Boeing said in a statement. ""We are honoured and privileged to support Prime Minister Modi's transformative vision for India, and we are grateful to have him dedicate the Boeing campus to foster aerospace innovation in the country,"" said David L Calhoun, Boeing president and CEO. Boeing has seen a surge in interest for its jets in India, currently the world's fastest-growing aviation market, with travel demand outstripping the supply of planes. On Thursday, the aircraft manufacturer received orders for 150 737 MAX narrow-body jets from Akasa Air, India's youngest carrier.

Apple farming had brought prosperity to many of his neighbours in the village of 150 households, after many of them converted their maize fields into apple orchards from 2000 onwards. Rajab would arrive early in the morning to tend to his apple trees. He would regularly spray them with pesticides and nutrients and employ scientific techniques such as maintaining 10-20 feet distance between them. When the fruit was ripening, he would stay the night at the orchard to protect it from wild bears. “I nurtured the orchard like a child,” says Rajab, in the hope that it would fetch him quality yield and profit. Over the past three years, however, recurrent economic losses have forced Rajab to reconsider apple farming."

Just a month earlier, the prime minister had declared that India would become the world’s third-largest economy in his third term, and the 7.8 per cent GDP growth for the first quarter of FY24, compared to 6.1 per cent in the previous one (Q4 of FY23), seemed to suggest that India was well on its way to get there."

A chic new riverfront is the latest addition to that frenzied beautification, though it has landed in a controversy over allegedly flouting environmental norms. Amid criticism, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot decided to distance himself from the inauguration. But can he justify the wanton spending on other projects? A helical clover bridge sounds like a sleek thing right out of some First World xanadu. This one, built at a cost of Rs 42 crore, is in Rajasthan’s Kota, but it soars and twists balletically too, for about a kilometre, except that it lands a few metres from where it started. Even more mystifyingly, it soars over nothing: there’s no crossing or rail track or any form of obstruction underneath. Just a few minutes away, along the Chambal, a new riverfront was inaugurated with great pomp on September 12—a costly façade laid end-to-end over three kilometres of natural rock and soil like a pink stone shroud, leaving not even parts of the riverbed, let alone a scrap of greenery. In its place have come up 26 spanking new ghats strung along imitation Rajputana architectural chic. Turrets and chhatris in the local Hadauti style. An army of giant statues, one of which, a 25-feet Yogimudra, vanishes when you see it straight on. Another curiosity is both visible and audible: the world’s largest bell whose boom, they say, can be heard eight kilometres away and, coming in at 82 tonnes on the scale, is no bantamweight either. Goddess Chambal, a deity who’s considered cursed and hence is rarely worshipped, also gets a 242-feet-high statue of Vietnamese marble here. The riverfront is studded liberally with replicas that stand like displaced metaphors, such as a highrise Red Fort or the Chinese Pagoda. Add a proposed boat cruise, a water park, a train on tyres, golf carts, skating area, the world’s second-largest musical fountain, cafes, restaurants, a commercial complexâ€æ in short, it’s the full fairground cornucopia. Kota (North) MLA and Rajasthan urban development minister Shanti Dhariwal, whose brainchild this frenzied beautification is, wanted to outdo the Kashi Corridor and the Sabarmati riverfront and take Kota right into the elite club of Paris and London. Dumb-struck critics call it the “world’s only copycat heritage waterfront”."

Since 2016, around 58 ‘Maratha Kranti Morchas’—some of them having hundreds of thousands of people joining them—were organised in Maharashtra and neighbouring states. The agitation turned violent in 2018, further beleaguering the then Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Shiv Sena coalition. There was speculation that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which has a strong base among the Marathas and was then in the Opposition, had fuelled these protests to corner Fadnavis, a Brahmin. However, the Maratha protests saw counter-mobilisation by the non-Marathas, especially by the upwardly mobile other backward classes (OBCs), who felt that the Marathas would eventually eat into their 27 per cent share of reservations. These groups organised ‘Bahujan Kranti Morchas’ across the state on similar lines."

But if experts are to be believed, it might have more to do with Xi's economic and political problems at home than China's friction with India. Listen to Story Chinese President Xi Jinping was born in the lap of luxury but, as his father was purged during China’s Cultural Revolution, a young Xi had to toil in the farms as a manual labourer in the countryside for 6 years. Those struggles would be nothing compared to the task the all-supreme leader now faces. Xi is skipping the G20 Summit in New Delhi and experts have failed to pin-point the one big reason why China is sending Premier Li Qiang instead. It is true that China’s relationship with India has been mostly frosty since the border clashes in May 2020. And it is also possible that the Chinese government decided to send Premier Li Qiang instead of President Xi to send out a signal. But the Chinese government has maintained that it was ready to work with all the parties for the global event's success in New Delhi this week. Also, Xi might not want to share the stage with the “tough crowd” at the G20. Many G20 member countries have “hardened their positions on China” in the last decade, said Paul Haenle, director of think-tank Carnegie China, adding, “It’s a tough crowd for Xi”. What experts are also hinting at is that Xi Jinping’s skipping the India-hosted G20 event could be due to the mounting troubles in China itself. So, is Xi staying back home where the real trouble is? We'd like two minutes of your time in order to understand you better. Please take this reader survey. Given Xi's focus on domestic issues, he might be unwilling to travel abroad, Alfred Wu, said associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. “Xi Jinping is setting his own agenda where his top concern is national security and he has to stay in China and make foreign leaders visit him instead,” Wu told Reuters. Wu says the over-emphasis on security is hurting China’s diplomatic ties and the attempt to rejuvenate its economy. China’s economy is in bad shape, and it is among Xi’s biggest headaches.HOUSING CRISIS HITS CHINA’S ECONOMY It seems the Chinese economy hasn’t emerged entirely from the Covid blow. It is the first time in decades that China’s economy is facing pressures from multiple fronts, to an extent that the entire world is jittery. Compared to last year, Chinese households are spending less, factories are producing less, and businesses are investing more slowly. Exports have slumped too. In August, China's exports dropped 8.8 per cent year-on-year and its imports contracted 7.3 per cent. advertisementDue to the sharp increase in youth unemployment, Beijing decided to stop disclosing the data. In the meantime, property prices are falling and some major developers have declared bankruptcy, putting the real estate sector in danger.The current economic obstacles that China faces have the potential to create a lethal mix that might spell the conclusion of its 40-year-long successful growth model. Economists say that China’s overdependence on the property sector for years coupled with its stringent Covid-related policy has significantly hampered its economic growth.Economists have always flagged China's debt-fuelled growth. It is seeing an astronomical rise in debt. China’s total debt-to-GDP ratio stood at a record 279 per cent in the first quarter of 2023, according to a Bloomberg analysis.Beijing appears to have paid a significant price for too much infrastructure spending over the years in the form of huge debt, and the housing bubble has already burst during the epidemic, beginning with the Evergrande catastrophe.The bigger fear is the contagion to the financial market.

In 2018, the National People’s Congress abolished term limits for China's president and vice president, thereby allowing Xi to continue in power as he wishes to.Over the years, Xi’s grip on power has become firmer.But there are concerns about a purge in China.

Xi is still worried about corruption in the ranks and has signalled that absolute loyalty [to the party] has not yet been achieved,” Lyle Morris, a foreign policy and national security expert at the Asia Society Policy Institute told the BBC.Then there was the surprise removal of Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang, a Xi confidant and the youngest to be appointed to that post, in July.No reason was given for Qin’s sudden removal and bringing back of his predecessor Wang Yi but it was seen as a failure on Xi’s part.“Since both moves are attributed to China's leader [Xi Jinping], this episode will be seen as an embarrassing lapse in judgment at the top,” Daniel Russel of the Asia Society Policy Institute told the BBC.

(Image: AFP) COMMUNIST PARTY ELDERS SLAM XITroubles and uncertainties at home have piled up pressure, but the trigger for Xi giving a miss to the G20 Summit could be the recent reprimand by Communist Party elders over his policy decisions.The turmoil over the removal of the military leaders and the minister hasn’t gone down well with the party elders, who led China to its economic dominance, according to a Nikkei Asia report.“A precursor [to Xi’s skipping the G20 Summit] seems to have been this summer’s Beidaihe meeting, the annual get-together of incumbent and retired leaders of the Chinese Communist Party at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, Hebei Province,” according to Nikkei Asia.The Japanese newspaper said a group of retired Communist Party of China elders reprimanded Xi Jinping “in ways they had not until now”. Xi later expressed his frustration to his closest aides, it quoted sources as saying.The elders were worried that if the political, economic and social turmoil continued, the Communist Party could lose support of the public, which could end its rule. The slowdown in China’s economy, the second-largest in the world, has hit its global image too. “Even Chinese companies in China have been making efforts to relocate outside of China,” Naomi Wilson, vice-president of policy, Asia and global trade at the Information Technology Industry Council, told the Washington Post.All these economic and political rumblings make President Xi’s position a little less secure.It is very probable that with troubles back home on economic, military and political fronts, Xi might have had an added reason to skip the India-hosted G20 summit in New Delhi.Purav Thakur helped with the research for this articlePublished By: Yudhajit Published On: Sep 7, 2023Must Watch Due to the sharp increase in youth unemployment, Beijing decided to stop disclosing the data.

(Image: AFP) COMMUNIST PARTY ELDERS SLAM XI Troubles and uncertainties at home have piled up pressure, but the trigger for Xi giving a miss to the G20 Summit could be the recent reprimand by Communist Party elders over his policy decisions. The turmoil over the removal of the military leaders and the minister hasn’t gone down well with the party elders, who led China to its economic dominance, according to a Nikkei Asia report. “A precursor [to Xi’s skipping the G20 Summit] seems to have been this summer’s Beidaihe meeting, the annual get-together of incumbent and retired leaders of the Chinese Communist Party at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, Hebei Province,” according to Nikkei Asia. The Japanese newspaper said a group of retired Communist Party of China elders reprimanded Xi Jinping “in ways they had not until now”. Xi later expressed his frustration to his closest aides, it quoted sources as saying. The elders were worried that if the political, economic and social turmoil continued, the Communist Party could lose support of the public, which could end its rule. The slowdown in China’s economy, the second-largest in the world, has hit its global image too. “Even Chinese companies in China have been making efforts to relocate outside of China,” Naomi Wilson, vice-president of policy, Asia and global trade at the Information Technology Industry Council, told the Washington Post. All these economic and political rumblings make President Xi’s position a little less secure. It is very probable that with troubles back home on economic, military and political fronts, Xi might have had an added reason to skip the India-hosted G20 summit in New Delhi.Purav Thakur helped with the research for this articlePublished By: Yudhajit Published On: Sep 7, 2023Must Watch"
Poll-bound Rajasthan | Welfare state,https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/nation/story/20230821-poll-bound-rajasthan-welfare-state-2419106-2023-08-11?utm_source=rss,"Fri, 11 Aug 2023 16:13:19+05:30",N/A,"Poll-bound Rajasthan | Welfare state Amidst a pre-election frenzy of welfare schemes and freebies, the Gehlot regime also enacts a couple of first-in-India bills Ascribe it to a genuine feel for the people or to plain shrewdness, but Ashok Gehlot has made social welfare a consistent focus of his administration. A special urgency to tend to the general weal seems to grip the Rajasthan chief minister especially before elections—a time such as now. Whether born of principle or exigency, this bent continues to give Rajasthan some pioneering policy moments. Back in 2011, during his second term, the Free Medicine Scheme was one such. More than an unthinking handout, it was an intervention that answered to a historical need, at a time when increasingly privatised healthcare was bleeding the mass of immiserated citizenry. Crafted around the procurement of generic medicines, it helped break the tyranny of huge mark-ups on branded drugs. Now, the budget session of 2023 brings forth two pieces of legislation that can have a similar historic stature in India, enacted as a response to the way the evolving economy is experienced at the bottom of the pyramid: the Rajasthan Platform-Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Bill, and the Minimum Income Guarantee Act."

KCR, as he is popularly known, finds himself backed into a corner with no takers for his national foray, barring a few farmer leaders in neighbouring Maharashtra.

At least that seems to be the strategy of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Chandrababu Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and actor Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party (JSP) as they plan to take on the ruling Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) and its founder, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, for the simultaneous assembly and parliamentary polls next year. Reddy himself firmly believes that his party, which won 151 of the 175 assembly seats and 22 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, can only do better. His belief stems from the slew of welfare schemes and populist measures that his government has launched in the past four years, which cover nearly all sections of society. The state government claims that 29 of its direct benefit transfer (DBT) schemes involving an expenditure of Rs 2.26 lakh crore have reached nearly 81.7 million beneficiaries in four years; another 11 non-DBT schemes with an expense of Rs 2.32 lakh crore have touched 53.8 million lives in the state."

On July 11, the Supreme Court put off the hearing against the tri-capital plan until December, which may force the CM to defer his moves to early 2024."
